4/12/13 9:01:12 am: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Hi regarding 5.3 test did not run in ci as some env failed to start. Checking it...
4/12/13 9:11:41 am: Takashi Yoshida: I noticed SKG env on nelskg2a kept failing to start when I was around last Thursday and Friday.
4/12/13 9:13:58 am: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Um the cms environment failed to start as it looks like some pow equipment added for phase 2 caused some issue.
4/12/13 9:14:56 am: Takashi Yoshida: Uh, ok. That's a different issue. Is this done on the DB?
4/12/13 9:15:38 am: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Yes
4/12/13 9:17:22 am: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Looks like we will not be able to release new packages to ivvq today
4/12/13 9:24:21 am: Takashi Yoshida: Would it work without the new DB changes?
4/12/13 9:26:48 am: Takashi Yoshida: I mean SBST doesn't need new POW for phase 2 yet.
4/12/13 9:27:55 am: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Yes so we decided to rollback to last db. But we still need to generate new tarball with dpc io status fix. This is the fastest solution for now
4/12/13 9:28:14 am: Marc Oliver Castañeda: At least we can start tests in afternoon.
4/12/13 9:28:31 am: Takashi Yoshida: Ok.
4/12/13 9:28:39 am: Marc Oliver Castañeda: We will not include those new power thingy
4/12/13 9:29:25 am: Takashi Yoshida: @Alexey: do I need to go to the technical meeting this morning?
4/12/13 9:30:55 am: Pierre Balthazar: Guys. I can manage the tech meeting. Focus on this release
4/12/13 9:30:58 am: Alexey Pakseykin: It's up to you.
4/12/13 9:31:24 am: Alexey Pakseykin: OK. So, I'm going to office now
4/12/13 9:31:31 am: Takashi Yoshida: Sounds like, no need to go. I guess ill head out to office instead.
4/12/13 9:31:42 am: Pierre Balthazar: Thank you guys
4/12/13 9:32:03 am: Takashi Yoshida: Thanks for making it easy.
4/12/13 9:35:07 am: Alexey Pakseykin: BTW, we have C752A guys coming to our office at 1:30PM - just a reminder. I'll need to attend a meeting for Cubicon and leave by 2PM.
4/12/13 9:37:45 am: Sylvain Bougerel: I am sorry guys, I might not be coming to work this morning, I am feeling sick. If I get better I'll be here in the afternoon.
4/12/13 1:22:11 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Hi Alexey, did you book a meeting room for this afternoon
4/12/13 1:27:11 pm: Alexey Pakseykin: Cherry (pardon for spelling), said there is no room.
4/12/13 1:27:48 pm: Alexey Pakseykin: I hope there are not too many people.
4/12/13 3:20:14 pm: Stephanie Rendal: @Sylvain, regarding time from RT to Wash Plant, about 9:24. Train exited RT1D at 12:51:16.261 and arrived at Wash Plant 13:10:40.298.
4/12/13 3:20:33 pm: Stephanie Rendal: Please tell Isaac
4/12/13 3:29:52 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Thanks. Ting Ting would like to know if it is possible to update the method statement and send by 4:30pm
4/12/13 3:39:13 pm: Stephanie Rendal: Ok we will modify and send by 4:30.
4/12/13 3:39:33 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Thanks
4/12/13 3:47:14 pm: Stephanie Rendal: uh about wash plant, i typed 9... I meant 19:24. Oops
4/12/13 4:17:09 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Lol. Okay, no worries.
5/12/13 10:04:27 am: Sylvain Bougerel: @ Stephanie, you coming to Depot later?
5/12/13 10:05:03 am: Stephanie Rendal: Yeah I'm actually on my way
5/12/13 10:05:20 am: Stephanie Rendal: Anyone else going?
5/12/13 10:08:07 am: Sylvain Bougerel: I will be here.
5/12/13 10:19:17 am: Stephanie Rendal: Ok
5/12/13 10:25:37 am: Imran bin Omar: Pls don't leave after both of you finish your meeting. I need to see you all & make little consultation.
5/12/13 10:34:43 am: Stephanie Rendal: Hi Imran, I will be there for train wash plant test scheduled at 11-3. (But it's probably not gonna take that long)
5/12/13 10:58:55 am: Stephanie Rendal: Im at depot room now. The test will start probably 11:30-11:45 accdg to lta
5/12/13 11:02:01 am: Imran bin Omar: It's ok. I've met Sylvain.
5/12/13 11:02:51 am: Sylvain Bougerel: oh you are at Depot already. lol, I must have missed you. okay, I am coming up
5/12/13 11:05:07 am: Stephanie Rendal: We are not testing yet though
5/12/13 11:06:18 am: Sylvain Bougerel: Yes, I am aware. I wanted to brief you a bit on update
5/12/13 12:27:29 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Hi stephanie can u get all the contents of log directory of both primary and redundant cms environment
5/12/13 12:27:54 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Even the subdirectories. Thanks
5/12/13 4:24:20 pm: Edgar Chong: Hi guys, can you kindly check if any of you are holding on to the thump drive with the serial no: C755A-FD2?
6/12/13 8:29:45 am: Pierre Balthazar: ⚠️⚠️ tmcsup crashed 3 times this morning bring down BOTH depot server this morning ⚠️⚠️
6/12/13 8:29:58 am: Pierre Balthazar: At least that's the info I just got
6/12/13 8:30:30 am: Pierre Balthazar: Apparently it was when operator was opening/using the launching table
6/12/13 8:30:51 am: Takashi Yoshida: Does anyone need to go there now?
6/12/13 8:33:35 am: Pierre Balthazar: Isaac is getting Alan to send us the logs. So no
6/12/13 8:33:48 am: Pierre Balthazar: But we get to work on it in office from the logs
6/12/13 8:34:40 am: Takashi Yoshida: If there's a core dump from tmcsup, it might help out a lot better
6/12/13 8:34:55 am: Pierre Balthazar: I hope so. I dunno yet
6/12/13 8:46:01 am: Pierre Balthazar: The first reaction from SBST will be to blame yesterday changes. Let's first make sure there's no link please
6/12/13 8:48:30 am: Stephanie Rendal: tmcsup core files will probably not be in the tmp directory. it will either be in conf/confats, conf/timetable, or scs.
6/12/13 8:49:21 am: Pierre Balthazar: Is that clear to everyone on the ops side?
6/12/13 8:49:33 am: Pierre Balthazar: We want them to collect the logs/core for us
6/12/13 8:49:46 am: Stephanie Rendal: i dont think so because its not normally where core files go
6/12/13 8:49:59 am: Stephanie Rendal: ive only seen this for tmcsup
6/12/13 8:51:35 am: Stephanie Rendal: if we call nelmco hotline can we reach maintenance ppl on site? who do we call to relay this info?
6/12/13 8:51:59 am: Pierre Balthazar: Either maintenance or Alan lye directly
6/12/13 8:52:09 am: Pierre Balthazar: You can try the maintenance hotline first
6/12/13 8:58:25 am: Stephanie Rendal: Ok i called maintenance and told them. If they find core files they will give to us along with the logs.
6/12/13 8:58:50 am: Pierre Balthazar: Great. Thanks
6/12/13 9:07:20 am: Pierre Balthazar: @Stephanie: aren't you planed to go onsite?
6/12/13 9:07:44 am: Pierre Balthazar: If yes, just try to have your back up on the effect of yesterday changes
6/12/13 9:07:57 am: Pierre Balthazar: As in knowing if there's a link or not.
6/12/13 9:08:22 am: Pierre Balthazar: And if no link, try to keep to your planed activities.
6/12/13 9:09:34 am: Stephanie Rendal: i was planning to go for the wash plant test at about 10:30 which I'm not sure will still push thru. So im going to office now. But I can go to site now instead.
6/12/13 9:10:13 am: Pierre Balthazar: I don't want us to go onsite because of this
6/12/13 9:10:42 am: Pierre Balthazar: But carrying our planned activities should show averts in level of confidence and professionalism
6/12/13 9:11:07 am: Pierre Balthazar: So do as per plan. Just try it to get dragged in this toouch
6/12/13 9:11:11 am: Pierre Balthazar: Too much
6/12/13 9:11:32 am: Stephanie Rendal: The original files are just in the system with file extension ".orig". I was also thinking twice about going since i feel like there might be about 20mins of test and an hour of wasting time (waiting, etc).
6/12/13 9:12:11 am: Pierre Balthazar: I leave it to you. You know your job better than I do :-)
6/12/13 9:13:09 am: Stephanie Rendal: Ok I will go to office.
6/12/13 9:13:27 am: Pierre Balthazar: Ok
6/12/13 9:26:23 am: Sylvain Bougerel: Our message should be that the crash is not related to yesterday 's changes, until it's 100% proven. We should try to talk SBST into carrying their train washing as planned.
6/12/13 9:27:38 am: Pierre Balthazar: Agreed
6/12/13 9:32:08 am: Pierre Balthazar: Just got my 6th call with Isaac: obviously everyone is targeting yesterday's change. So please have a look at the cores and logs quickly and demonstrate there's no link with that
6/12/13 9:32:34 am: Pierre Balthazar: Apparently some segmentation faults have been seen in radcom... Could be linked I'm afraid
6/12/13 9:35:08 am: Stephanie Rendal: Then maybe it was radcom that crashed and not tmcsup
6/12/13 9:35:29 am: Pierre Balthazar: Dunno...
6/12/13 9:40:10 am: Takashi Yoshida: Normally, how do we get logs and cores from the maintenance team?
6/12/13 9:42:03 am: Stephanie Rendal: i can test yesterdays changes with train launching and see if it has any effect (while logs arent here yet)
6/12/13 9:42:32 am: Pierre Balthazar: @Takashi: don't know
@Stephanie: not a bad idea
6/12/13 9:43:53 am: Pierre Balthazar: <media omitted>
6/12/13 9:43:56 am: Pierre Balthazar: From Isaac
6/12/13 10:17:48 am: Pierre Balthazar: Quick discussion with Isaac:
6/12/13 10:18:03 am: Pierre Balthazar: <media omitted>
6/12/13 10:20:01 am: Takashi Yoshida: So either way, someone's gonna have a lousy Saturday morning.
6/12/13 10:23:29 am: Pierre Balthazar: I'm trying to avoid that as much as possible
6/12/13 10:23:36 am: Imran bin Omar: Ohh.... Welcome to NEL life!
Never Ending Line...
6/12/13 10:24:03 am: Imran bin Omar: Just lighten up mood a bit....
6/12/13 10:24:26 am: Pierre Balthazar: Ha ha ha
6/12/13 10:24:43 am: Stephanie Rendal: Hahaha
6/12/13 10:24:52 am: Pierre Balthazar: Btw, SBST launched trains yesterday at the start of peak evening hours
6/12/13 10:25:00 am: Takashi Yoshida: I wish Imran told me about this much earlier.
6/12/13 10:25:06 am: Pierre Balthazar: It should have crashed then if it was our last change
6/12/13 10:25:08 am: Pierre Balthazar: No?
6/12/13 10:25:42 am: Stephanie Rendal: Yes. I can't reproduce it either here.
6/12/13 10:26:32 am: Stephanie Rendal: If they want it reverted its easy to give instructions. But to wait around....
6/12/13 10:26:54 am: Pierre Balthazar: I know. It sucks
6/12/13 10:27:15 am: Pierre Balthazar: We need a quick analysis to ensure we all have a peaceful sat morning
6/12/13 10:35:11 am: Pierre Balthazar: Some more info
6/12/13 10:35:26 am: Pierre Balthazar: <media omitted>
6/12/13 10:37:20 am: Takashi Yoshida: In any case, until we have logs and cores, all we can do is speculate here.
6/12/13 10:38:08 am: Pierre Balthazar: How/when are we getting them
6/12/13 10:47:12 am: Stephanie Rendal: Ok I called them and they said they cant send anyone to the office coz they need them at depot so Marc is going there
6/12/13 10:47:36 am: Pierre Balthazar: Ok. Thanks
6/12/13 10:48:24 am: Pierre Balthazar: Even though I heard they invented something called internet which allowed to send data acros... Not sure how it works though 😜
6/12/13 10:48:41 am: Stephanie Rendal: to get the logs and he also needs to check on something .
6/12/13 10:49:00 am: Pierre Balthazar: No probs. just teasing
6/12/13 10:49:37 am: Stephanie Rendal: Hahaha. The data will be too big to send via email and we dont have some kind of ftp site or any data exchange site set up
6/12/13 12:34:22 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: I might be delayed getting back got caught by the rain. No taxi around will try to find one
6/12/13 6:10:05 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Guys, what is the exact ne of the dialog used when DCS crashed this morning? We've got a screen shot?
6/12/13 6:10:11 pm: Pierre Balthazar: It's for Isaac management
6/12/13 6:10:17 pm: Pierre Balthazar: SBST is playing dumb
6/12/13 6:10:52 pm: Takashi Yoshida: What's ne?
6/12/13 6:11:19 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Name
6/12/13 6:11:22 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Grrrrrr
6/12/13 6:12:48 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: As discussed with Isaac, it is not a dialog, but a popup window with error code, to tell the operator that the operation did not complete successfully.
6/12/13 6:13:18 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: this is the popup that would occur, if the error was properly handled.
6/12/13 6:14:36 pm: Pierre Balthazar: I meant the dialog in use by the operator at the moment of the crash
6/12/13 6:14:46 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Train information panel?
6/12/13 6:15:08 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: sorry, train launching table
6/12/13 6:15:53 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Thanks
6/12/13 6:16:33 pm: Takashi Yoshida: FYI, Tingting told me that increasing CMS trace needs to be postponed to tomorrow night. She says the method statement came too late.
6/12/13 6:17:02 pm: Pierre Balthazar: F them!
6/12/13 6:17:07 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Ok. Thanks
6/12/13 6:18:19 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Sylvain: the dialog you Isaac about for the train readiness mode is the train inspector panel or something else?
6/12/13 6:18:52 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Yes
6/12/13 6:19:07 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Thanks
6/12/13 6:20:12 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Tingting will confirm later about the CMS trace level can proceed tomorrow night
6/12/13 6:24:46 pm: Alexey Pakseykin: If I'm not mistaken, they (Alan) mentioned single NED crash when playing with train launching table before (Last Friday during defect meeting), but didn't push for immediate action. They verbally described it, and I asked for the workflow/screenshots they used, but we were busy to handle this since then. So, there could be more cores and logs than just today's ones.
6/12/13 6:26:37 pm: Pierre Balthazar: What's the train readiness mode they should wait for? Exact wording
6/12/13 6:26:54 pm: Stephanie Rendal: Wakeup
6/12/13 6:27:12 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Thanks
6/12/13 6:39:57 pm: Pierre Balthazar: @Takashi: are you still going on site tonight?
6/12/13 6:40:28 pm: Takashi Yoshida: No
6/12/13 6:41:02 pm: Takashi Yoshida: It'll be tomorrow night if she can get SBST to agree.
6/12/13 6:41:24 pm: Takashi Yoshida: She = Tingting
6/12/13 6:41:28 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Well... Maybe. I'll call you if the shit raiymond is trying to push goes through
6/12/13 6:41:59 pm: Takashi Yoshida: I don't like the sound of this. What am I going for?
6/12/13 6:42:54 pm: Pierre Balthazar: To crash the system. Raymond really is a dumb ass
6/12/13 6:44:15 pm: Takashi Yoshida: To what end?
6/12/13 6:45:26 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Basically SBST challenge our findings. So go there, reproduce this morning crash and leave them with both servers down
6/12/13 6:45:50 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Btw, I'm afraid you will have to restart the servers :-)
6/12/13 6:46:50 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Why don't they do that without us? They can get the maintenance to restart the servers.
6/12/13 6:47:59 pm: Takashi Yoshida: So is this official?
6/12/13 6:48:21 pm: Takashi Yoshida: I'll wait for your words. Sorry.
6/12/13 6:52:41 pm: Pierre Balthazar: I'm still trying to understand the exact plan
6/12/13 6:53:01 pm: Pierre Balthazar: But basically SBST is playing games and we need to comply to fight back
6/12/13 6:53:08 pm: Takashi Yoshida: No plan is better than a stupid plan.
6/12/13 6:53:34 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Ha ha ha
6/12/13 6:54:07 pm: Pierre Balthazar: But if you go there with no plan you'll end up doing everything and anything
6/12/13 6:57:03 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Do they still insist on crashing depot? I mean if it doesn't crash, it still doesn't mean anything.
6/12/13 6:58:56 pm: Takashi Yoshida: We also tried to reproduce ATS crash but that didn't work. It took a NIAP a week later to find out that fixed code path was executed.
6/12/13 7:01:57 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: What is this? They wanna fix it they think they have found the reason of the crash? find ask them what is their conclusion? if they wanna crash the server, they can do it without our help... We are walking on our heads here...
6/12/13 7:03:17 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Any particular reasons why they are disputing our findings?
6/12/13 7:04:34 pm: Stephanie Rendal: Maybe they want to believe it was yesterdays fixes that caused the crash? Grr.
6/12/13 7:04:53 pm: Pierre Balthazar: They are walking on our heads and trust me: I've been on that shit for hours now with Isaac
6/12/13 7:05:09 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Yes. They believe it's our fixes
6/12/13 7:06:28 pm: Pierre Balthazar: At the moment: that's their request:
1. Crash the current system doing the same thing (please use the same train)
2. Revert changes and crash it again
6/12/13 7:06:52 pm: Pierre Balthazar: From there, we should put the changes back in and restart and leave
6/12/13 7:07:06 pm: Pierre Balthazar: In exchange, we can set up traces on CMS
6/12/13 7:07:39 pm: Pierre Balthazar: If everything goes as above, I'm not sending any of you onsite without us willing to be there
6/12/13 7:07:56 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Basically, I'll use the "we told you so"
6/12/13 7:08:19 pm: Pierre Balthazar: I'm angry and frustrated beyond recognition...
6/12/13 7:08:21 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Is this the final plan?
6/12/13 7:08:23 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Sorry guys!
6/12/13 7:08:31 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Yes
6/12/13 7:08:47 pm: Takashi Yoshida: I need information on how to revert the changes.
6/12/13 7:09:21 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Suppose I need to go back to office and read the method statement on this.
6/12/13 7:09:26 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Stephanie, can you point Takashi where to look? I understood it was quite simple
6/12/13 7:11:53 pm: Pierre Balthazar: That's what I just sent Isaac:
btw, we will be using the same train as this morning. Not negotiable.
6/12/13 7:12:24 pm: Takashi Yoshida: That's fine.
6/12/13 7:12:37 pm: Stephanie Rendal: Ok I'll call Takashi in a while
6/12/13 7:13:45 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Thanks
6/12/13 7:13:56 pm: Stephanie Rendal: Its not really simple it requires some timing. Im at a dinner get-together right now I'll call in about 30mins
6/12/13 7:14:52 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Is this something I can do if I follow the method statement?
6/12/13 7:40:49 pm: Stephanie Rendal: What method statement? Anyway i'll call you
6/12/13 7:54:54 pm: Stephanie Rendal: I am going with Takashi tonight but will leave early.
6/12/13 7:56:35 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Ok. Thanks a lot Stephanie
6/12/13 7:56:36 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Thanks. I'll try to learn so you don't need to stay too late.
6/12/13 8:00:28 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Can you please let me know how this whole thing goes. Thanks a lot
6/12/13 8:00:47 pm: Takashi Yoshida: No problem
6/12/13 8:02:17 pm: Stephanie Rendal: @Pierre is it confirmed we are going to use the same train (Car# 041) in case its train issue?
6/12/13 8:02:49 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Yes
6/12/13 8:03:08 pm: Pierre Balthazar: If it's not the same train. Refuse any test and go home.
6/12/13 8:03:17 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Use my words for this
6/12/13 8:05:40 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: No. We won't do it. I am sorry.
6/12/13 8:05:56 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: the method statement has been refused, well too bad.
6/12/13 8:07:22 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: If they want to dispute our finding, I want to see their analysis. What back up their claim?
6/12/13 8:07:56 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: They have operations to run, we have given them all the necessary information so that they run their operations safely.
6/12/13 8:12:30 pm: Stephanie Rendal: If there is no test tonight I'm not complaining. I don't get it also why they would dispute it
6/12/13 8:13:43 pm: Imran bin Omar: Anyway, Pierre just sharing with you what Tingting wrote as you are not in the other chat grp>>>
6/12/13 8:13:54 pm: Imran bin Omar: <media omitted>
6/12/13 8:14:23 pm: Imran bin Omar: So it seems they will use same train...
6/12/13 8:15:43 pm: Takashi Yoshida: To be honest, it would have been safer for me to be out of the other chat group.
6/12/13 8:15:45 pm: Pierre Balthazar: The msg starting with just say is from me to Isaac :-)
6/12/13 8:16:14 pm: Pierre Balthazar: I just called Sylvain. Is a little bit care now :-)
6/12/13 8:16:21 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Now I need to be extra careful where I sprinkle F-words.
6/12/13 8:16:47 pm: Pierre Balthazar: We go ahead tonight and we crash that damn servers. The. I'll have all the weapons to make SBST pay their stupidity and arogance
6/12/13 8:16:52 pm: Pierre Balthazar: I'm really sorry guys
6/12/13 8:17:11 pm: Takashi Yoshida: No problem. Just hoping it goes in our favor.
6/12/13 8:17:16 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Sorry their will be testing tonight. Thanks Takashi and Stephanie for volunteering.
6/12/13 8:17:41 pm: Pierre Balthazar: @talashi: me too
6/12/13 8:34:14 pm: Stephanie Rendal: Okies. Haha sorry Takashi I asked Tingting to add you haha you'll have to behave now
6/12/13 8:35:13 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Seems like it
7/12/13 12:04:29 am: Takashi Yoshida: On my way to OCC
7/12/13 1:05:30 am: Pierre Balthazar: Have we started?
7/12/13 1:06:24 am: Takashi Yoshida: Still waiting
7/12/13 2:03:11 am: Pierre Balthazar: Any luck guys?
7/12/13 2:04:17 am: Takashi Yoshida: So far, no luck in reproducing it with wash plant patch
7/12/13 2:06:18 am: Pierre Balthazar: I guess that's the end then. No point going further I believe
7/12/13 2:32:10 am: Stephanie Rendal: So we reverted the patch and did the same test (assigning/reassigning trains on launching table) and it did not crash. Conclusion is the wash plant fix was not the cause and they are asking us to put back the changes on the wash plant fix. So that is what we are doing now.
7/12/13 2:33:23 am: Pierre Balthazar: Ok. Thanks. Once done escape and go home please
7/12/13 2:37:30 am: Stephanie Rendal: We need to set cms traces first then we go
8/12/13 2:11:35 pm: Alexey Pakseykin: How to call maintenance team?
8/12/13 2:12:27 pm: Pierre Balthazar: They've got an hotline number but I do t have it with me
8/12/13 2:12:34 pm: ‪+65 9749 1446‬: you can call 62140674
8/12/13 2:12:46 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Here you go ;-)
8/12/13 2:12:51 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Any issue?
8/12/13 2:19:16 pm: Alexey Pakseykin: Disk failure (maybe not fatal, just started complaining about sectors)...
8/12/13 2:23:06 pm: Pierre Balthazar: On which machine?
8/12/13 2:23:25 pm: Alexey Pakseykin: NED GWS.
8/12/13 2:23:43 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Can we make sure we get all information on that: I want to push it back to procurement and see what we can get
8/12/13 2:23:57 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Ok. Thanks.
8/12/13 2:24:15 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Weird you got called before maintenance though. Who called you?
8/12/13 2:24:43 pm: Alexey Pakseykin: This is the novel I wrote into C755A group:

There is no much user/valuable information on GWS (correct me if I'm wrong). Therefore, no reason to back up. If disk fails completely, the software will be reinstalled and system re-configured again anyway. So, do the 3rd - non-recommended action (do not ask again). But as Arnaud said, we need to find out which GWS it is to take action without forgetting the problem. The maintenance team has to identify whether it is hardware (there are disk diagnostics reported by hardware) and if it is fatal,  replace the disk, then reinstall everything. I believe we can live with it until Monday. In the worst case, another GWS should allow operations done in NED.

Tingting called me.
8/12/13 2:26:01 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Ok. Thanks
8/12/13 2:26:35 pm: Alexey Pakseykin: The screenshot sent by Nurul.
8/12/13 2:47:26 pm: Alexey Pakseykin: <media omitted>
8/12/13 4:07:20 pm: Pierre Balthazar: From Isaac just now:
Both cms crashed, while doing pis message to train. Now up one of the server.
8/12/13 4:07:36 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Any idea on this? Heard anything?
8/12/13 4:16:37 pm: Takashi Yoshida: None. Thought some part of PIS also go through Rad though. Can't remember if there's any useful traces for PIS.
8/12/13 4:18:33 pm: Pierre Balthazar: I hope so: we will have some more explanation to give on Monday...
8/12/13 4:21:59 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Let see what really crashed. It may be different from last time.
8/12/13 4:22:46 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: Someone is going down?
8/12/13 4:22:59 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Can we ensure we've got the logs and cores available tomorrow? Can maintenance picking this up for us?
8/12/13 4:23:15 pm: Pierre Balthazar: I'd rather not have anyone from our side going
8/12/13 4:24:20 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Normally, maintenance can pick it up. I can check with Matthew to see who is on site today...
8/12/13 4:24:53 pm: Pierre Balthazar: lets do that and arrange so we have everything available tomorrow morning
8/12/13 4:25:05 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: Or can just call the TO number to ask them...
8/12/13 4:26:44 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: I am sending a message to Matthew, you can call the TO too, it's a good idea.
8/12/13 4:28:37 pm: Pierre Balthazar: I'm trying to work with Isaac to pacify SBST. Any info is welcome
8/12/13 4:29:33 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: From Matthew: toe will do night standy at occ from 9pm onwards. now no ppl
8/12/13 4:30:29 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Who restarted the CMS then?
8/12/13 4:30:58 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: No idea... the DO?
8/12/13 4:34:28 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Toe number: +65 9067 9344
8/12/13 4:34:34 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: Yes qiuqiu from SBST restated both CMS
8/12/13 4:34:48 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: At 15:17 cms was up
8/12/13 4:35:32 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Thanks Arnaud.
8/12/13 4:35:39 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: Jerwin is on-site but he may not come tomorrow at the office, I asked them to help us to collect the logs and cores
8/12/13 4:36:44 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: If you really need them by tmr morning I don't mind to come down..
8/12/13 4:37:29 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Would be better: LTA will ask a report by tomorrow evening (again)
8/12/13 4:37:54 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: And by the way Qiuqiu confirmed me that pisclt crashed..
8/12/13 7:05:04 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: Pisctl crashed when sending a free text message to a train for testing purpose.when clicking display, both CMS crashed in the same time.cores and logs taken.
8/12/13 7:21:05 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Interesting. So long as there are cores...
9/12/13 10:39:22 am: Pierre Balthazar: @Stephanie: we're not allowed to set up higher level of traces. So I told Isaac there's no point for is to go
9/12/13 10:40:04 am: Stephanie Rendal: Yeah you are right
9/12/13 10:40:21 am: Pierre Balthazar: Thanks.

9/12/13 10:20:34 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Good evening to you in the NEL Universe!
Apparently what happened just now is: 
Cms1 inputmgr crashed. Cms2 radcom crashed

Trying to get more info now...
9/12/13 10:21:00 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Apparently CMS 2 crashed when they were restarting CMS 1. Both went down together
9/12/13 10:26:59 pm: Pierre Balthazar: @Sylvain: btw, I forgot to answer your email. Can you make it to HSO for 11am tomorrow? Just you and I should be ok. Thanks
9/12/13 11:27:13 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: Hi all,
According to the TO, CMS on nelscs1a crashed when doing a PA broadcast, (input manager went down), when restarting cms1, cms2 crashed so both servers were down. On the second time, the TO restarted one by one without any issue..
Second pb reported, nedgws became slow and the 3 monitors became blank with a pop-up error mentioning a system hard disk error, again. The had to reboot 5 time the Gws before manage to get it back to normal but still with a slowness according to them. Are we facing a hardware issue?!
If it's necessary for the team to get the differents files for investigation, let me know.
Regards
Regards
9/12/13 11:29:27 pm: ‪+65 9749 1446‬: hi arnaud, do you know specifically which nedgws?
9/12/13 11:31:51 pm: Pierre Balthazar: I believe it's GWS 1. That's what I got from Isaac
9/12/13 11:39:16 pm: ‪+65 9749 1446‬: ok, as long is not gws 2 & 3. we can buy some time to find out the problem. at the mean time we should be preparing to replace the harddisk. @edgar: do we have spare harddisk, if not i suggest to take the one from platform.
9/12/13 11:40:15 pm: Pierre Balthazar: We have 3 was at the back of occ including one which can be used straight away. Probably easier just to swap towers. No?
9/12/13 11:40:58 pm: Edgar Chong: We do not have spare harddisk.
9/12/13 11:42:06 pm: Edgar Chong: We can set 1 of e pc at the back of e occ to nedgws1a. This will be faster.
9/12/13 11:42:47 pm: Pierre Balthazar: As for the HDD, I want to run that through procurement. I don't believe it should crash that fast
9/12/13 11:43:37 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Btw, I've asked Izad to put all logs and cores on one of these GWS for me to pick them up tomorrow morning (I'll be at occ at 9)
9/12/13 11:44:29 pm: ‪+65 9749 1446‬: yup, i think easier to swap the tower first.
9/12/13 11:48:15 pm: ‪+65 9749 1446‬: @edgar: just to check, are we able to install program using c755a profile?
9/12/13 11:50:20 pm: ‪+65 9749 1446‬: sorry, i mean opernel profile?
9/12/13 11:52:56 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: @ Andy,
We haven't check yet, I'll try it tomorrow morning on the platform, it should be fine. what's the behavior expected?
9/12/13 11:58:37 pm: Nimesh Chauhan: Behaviour expected result must a normal installation. 
But not sure that will it be a normal or abnormal. Need to test at platform.
10/12/13 12:03:35 am: ‪+65 9749 1446‬: @arnaud: discuss with you in office tommorow.
10/12/13 9:23:57 am: Sylvain Bougerel: For HDD, just call HP support, give the computer number, which is on the tag. They will have to send an engineer to diagnose the fault, then they will replace the hard disk. They can leave the old one for us to do a clone.
10/12/13 9:26:43 am: Sylvain Bougerel: The HDD from HP seem quite weak. Just for info Chandra faced the same issue on his HP computer at the office: HDD failure. The above is how we proceeded for the replacement. You can still run this through procurement... but you know... if we want to get things done quickly... :-)
10/12/13 9:41:00 am: Pierre Balthazar: Picking up logs from yesterday. Who wants them?
10/12/13 9:47:43 am: Alexey Pakseykin: We all want them. We can share.
10/12/13 9:48:21 am: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Normally if these are input mgr crashes we cannot do anything about it. We just wait to migrate to 5.3 and wait until it happens so we can forward core file to scadasoft team
10/12/13 9:48:31 am: Marc Oliver Castañeda: If they assist
10/12/13 11:56:40 am: Pierre Balthazar: Guys, can someone make a trip to OCC to swap the faulty GWS with one from the back?
10/12/13 11:57:06 am: Pierre Balthazar: We've got the green light to do that today during low activity period without paperwork
10/12/13 12:31:09 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: Okay I'll move to Occ after lunch..
10/12/13 12:31:47 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Thanks Arnaud
10/12/13 12:33:12 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: No pb!
10/12/13 1:20:55 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Hi, just to let you know guys, LTA is fighting for a slot on Sunday morning to do our latest release. So let's get the latest fix in by Wednesday, to release on Thursday.
10/12/13 1:39:14 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Ok. That's the plan so far.
10/12/13 3:00:23 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Hi Arnaud, Would you be able to retrieve the content of /home/operats/conf/* on ATS environnement in nelats1a and nelats2a and bring it back to the office. Thanks, Sylvain
10/12/13 3:07:34 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: Okay I will
11/12/13 10:31:39 am: Imran bin Omar: Which meeting room is the progress meeting?

11/12/13 10:32:38 am: ‪+65 9749 1446‬: its beside LTOC
11/12/13 10:34:07 am: Imran bin Omar: Yeah m outside LTOC, usual 5-1-4 closed for renovation.
11/12/13 10:34:31 am: Imran bin Omar: It's ok Isaac with me
11/12/13 12:08:53 pm: Takashi Yoshida: @Arnaud E., replacement hard disks are on your desk. There are two boxes.
11/12/13 12:27:26 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: Ok thks Takashi
12/12/13 9:46:23 am: Arnaud Roubaud: Hi guys... I received a quick fix for the animator issue and it seems to be working fine so far
12/12/13 10:50:02 am: Sylvain Bougerel: Wao, that's fast.  Good, at least we can go ahead with internal release.
12/12/13 11:27:03 am: Jean-Louis Tang: Hi Arnaud,
What was the issue with animator?
13/12/13 10:44:57 am: Sylvain Bougerel: Hi Stephanie, are you in depot already?
13/12/13 10:45:30 am: Stephanie Rendal: Hi sylvain yes im in depot already
13/12/13 10:46:19 am: Stephanie Rendal: Something happened like some train fault and a pec (not sure)
13/12/13 10:46:57 am: Stephanie Rendal: Anyway were not testing yet. Are you coming?
9/2/14 2:52:43 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda was removed
9/2/14 2:52:43 pm: Chandrakanth Thoutam was removed
9/2/14 12:53:42 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: From Marc:

9/2/14 12:53:46 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: hi. For.the dbs and crystal reports issue there are 2 issues. For server side the issue is resolved. For gws, need.to set file.permissions of oracle.client folder because of hardening, opernel has no write access. Anyway we only fixed for now 2 occ gws. Because of the delicate.situation we are now in me nurul and.the do agreed to monitor these for up to tom if everything ok we create.formal.method statement and.fic remaining gws in occ and all.stations. i will email tom.details.of.the issues.

9/2/14 1:13:11 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Now you can see generated reports
9/2/14 1:13:26 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: There is no more error when u check results
9/2/14 1:55:55 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Well done. Shall we update our package to check for write access? is it even possible to do that?
9/2/14 2:52:43 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda joined
9/2/14 4:31:17 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Um any user able to execute the instAller normally has admin access thereby they will always have write access. However we can do the checking when our gws starts up.
9/2/14 4:44:14 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Good point.
12/2/14 3:27:31 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: Hi team,
Just to let you know, the C752A test passed last night. The TSR was working properly. No issue was encountered even from BGK to SKG on RT1..
12/2/14 7:43:58 pm: Edgar Chong: Hi guys, for tonight train wash test is cancelled
13/2/14 9:54:59 am: Takashi Yoshida: There's some shortage of taxi this morning around Tanah Merah. Guess I'll be at office later than I thought.
14/2/14 4:24:03 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Hey guys, good luck for tonight. Don't forget to update us after the tests! Cheers!
15/2/14 5:20:59 am: Jean-Louis Tang: We can see the new ds in the sector 10: no blue schematics, no toggling, no crash and the system is stable. We see valid status (no inconsistent values anymore) with correct DS status that are consistent with abb side. We only notice a faulty plc detected by mbcc.
Abb simulate remote/local status that is accordingly updated in gws. A few screenshots below

15/2/14 5:21:01 am: Jean-Louis Tang: <media omitted>
15/2/14 5:27:32 am: Jean-Louis Tang: We had time to do a few send control tests with one of the DS but it fails with bad return conditions. According to ctlcmd traces, it is due to a timeout. I took de logs with higher ctl traces level n some screenshots of the DS do in the browser. Too bad i didn't activate spy log for cms. I only activate it in depot...:(
15/2/14 6:07:32 am: Imran bin Omar: For EMC test for Tetrapol Radio at Depot & SKG, completed & passed.
15/2/14 9:42:44 am: Sylvain Bougerel: For the failed control, I assume it was on a new DS, not on an existing one, right? What kind of control was attempted? Have you reverted the database rpm or have you left it in place? Is tonight sampling still on?

Well done otherwise, it's a major step forward.
15/2/14 9:44:21 am: Takashi Yoshida: Yeah. After all the troubles, it looks pretty damn good. Hopefully we can keep it this way.
15/2/14 2:19:47 pm: Jean-Louis Tang: Yup, we tried to close a new DS. We are able to display current status of the new equipments, so no revert was done and my patch is currently deployed in both cms and depot.
16/2/14 3:33:59 am: Jean-Louis Tang: Tonite's regression tests on existing ned power switches all passed.
16/2/14 7:52:12 am: Pierre Balthazar: Great! Thanks for the update!
16/2/14 10:06:56 pm: Stephanie Rendal: Who is going to the train wash test?
16/2/14 10:08:15 pm: Edgar Chong: Hi, I will be getting Nimesh to go down. Do you have any thing that you want him to take note of?
16/2/14 10:10:41 pm: Stephanie Rendal: just the same thing I said before. I was just curious.
17/2/14 4:03:38 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Task 1464 and 1463, are they redundant?
17/2/14 4:05:57 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Not sure. I'll ask Stephanie
17/2/14 4:07:16 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: @ Alexey, do you have the full logs of the day where there was network saturation?
17/2/14 4:07:48 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: For nelats2a
17/2/14 4:08:43 pm: Alexey Pakseykin: Yes, I have.
17/2/14 4:14:47 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Don't know enough to say they're redundant or not. Stephanie encountered it on integration platform but didn't pursue it further.
17/2/14 4:45:54 pm: Stephanie Rendal: Hi Sylvain. No they are not redundant. The train sim in phase 1 does not start at all. The issue in phase 2 is that the train sim starts but if running only ned you get the error "Unknown car #" if ats is not connected when previously you are supposed to be able to create trains and generally use the train sim with ned only.
17/2/14 4:46:26 pm: Stephanie Rendal: i dont know how important the phase 1 issue is...
17/2/14 6:40:18 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Well, it is important if it also doesn't work in TDS. It also becomes important if we have to release a new patch on site for this...
18/2/14 5:40:21 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Hi, whoever is going for weekly wash tomorrow, please take a video, if possible, in particular when the train is about to leave the plant.
18/2/14 5:41:11 pm: Stephanie Rendal: hi sylvain. ok i will be the one to go
18/2/14 5:49:36 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: We need to check the timing during which the route after P815 is set with regard to train position ,and for how long it is held. SBST claims it is held for longer than before. 2. We need to capture train Window position : SBST claims train Window still disappeared temporarily.
18/2/14 5:50:59 pm: Stephanie Rendal: ok I will take note
18/2/14 10:05:36 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: <media omitted>
18/2/14 10:06:17 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Pis/Ats notification got issue it seems :-(
18/2/14 10:07:16 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Can't see. It's out of focus.
18/2/14 10:10:58 pm: Imran bin Omar: You can volunteer to the SM to solve it... hehehe
18/2/14 10:16:44 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Maybe Sotong are playing with our switches again :-P
18/2/14 10:21:03 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: Nice one!
18/2/14 11:53:47 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Isaac called me earlier and wants me to come for a recap tomorrow at 9 at LTA to explain what we are going to do. So I will do that before the actual technical meeting.
18/2/14 11:54:58 pm: Pierre Balthazar: About what? Power?
18/2/14 11:56:52 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Just a heads up about the meeting this afternoon : we will have to prepare a method statement for a test at night engineering hours, for the ITC C759A. We need to print the list of tests, and in the method statement we need to include a request to borrow the protocol analyzer. You can discuss with Rozaini, he know what it is. LTA is planning to get a possession for Depot to perform ITC.
18/2/14 11:58:00 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Ok. Do you want me to come down with you or you prefer to keep it more techie?
18/2/14 11:59:20 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: The protocol analyzer needs to be used to certify that we are sending the commands. Rozaini is the only person I know who knows how to use it, but maybe maintenance guys know to, and we could get their help. Jean-Louis can explain the purpose, since Takashi will not be in the office.
19/2/14 12:00:45 am: Sylvain Bougerel: So just to summarize:
1. We need the list of ITC C759A tests printed, 
2. A method statement sent before 2pm to request for protocol analyzer and an explanation of what needs to be done to use it.
19/2/14 12:02:31 am: Sylvain Bougerel: Pierre, your presence will be appreciated, I expect Mr Koh will be there. Takashi, your presence is optional - I think you already knows what will be discussed, so no need to go for it again.
19/2/14 12:03:00 am: Pierre Balthazar: @Sylvain: I'll be there
19/2/14 12:03:37 am: Pierre Balthazar: @edgar: we need a name in front of the two actions above by 9:15 latest so we can meet the deadline. Thanks in advance
19/2/14 12:05:49 am: Sylvain Bougerel: I understand this is all very rushed, LTA gave us a deadline for power on by the end of the week, "no matter what", so we got to make it work. C759A and ABB will be there too.
19/2/14 12:07:08 am: Sylvain Bougerel: All this is subject to LTA getting a PTW-E for Depot... which means that we might do all this for nothing if they don't get it. -  Sorry in Advance.
19/2/14 12:08:28 am: Jean-Louis Tang: In the method statement we might need to highlight that one tcl file will be patched in order to hv the control right in ned environment.
19/2/14 12:16:48 am: Sylvain Bougerel: Yes, and possibly Depot server restart in case we change mapping.
19/2/14 12:18:13 am: Sylvain Bougerel: Jean-Louis can you check the contents and help Edgar's team with writing the method statement tomorrow?
19/2/14 12:27:28 am: Arnaud Esbelin: I'll be helping for the method statement tmr..
19/2/14 12:39:40 am: Jean-Louis Tang: Ok, let's see tmr.
19/2/14 6:44:33 am: Edgar Chong: @Sylvain: you need the printed itc c759A @ 9am for the meeting with LTA?
19/2/14 6:45:34 am: Pierre Balthazar: Nope. For the site test I believe. Together with the MS
19/2/14 6:45:36 am: Edgar Chong: @Arnaud: Thanks for helping the methpd statement.
19/2/14 6:47:16 am: Edgar Chong: Ok. We already have the ITC POW test procedure in SVN. Can print out anytime.
19/2/14 6:58:41 am: Pierre Balthazar: Just dot forget it ;-)
19/2/14 8:33:22 am: Sylvain Bougerel: technical meeting remains at 10:30Am. but there will be another meeting for POW at 9AM
19/2/14 9:05:49 am: Takashi Yoshida: Should I be at the tech meeting this morning?
19/2/14 9:07:19 am: Pierre Balthazar: We can manage without you. So it's up to you from my side
19/2/14 9:07:32 am: Pierre Balthazar: Could you send me the updated defect list though?
19/2/14 9:08:57 am: Takashi Yoshida: Ok, I'll send it before the tech meeting.
19/2/14 9:09:28 am: Pierre Balthazar: Ok. Thanks
19/2/14 9:18:05 am: Stephanie Rendal: At OCC now for the train wash test.
19/2/14 9:24:21 am: Edgar Chong: Thanks Steph for supporting the train wash test.
19/2/14 9:37:38 am: ‪+65 9749 1446‬: Pierre, i will be joining u in the tech meeting
19/2/14 10:21:24 am: Sylvain Bougerel: Hi, just got info from Pei Shan that they got Depot possession for ISCS tonight.
19/2/14 10:21:40 am: Pierre Balthazar: Great!
19/2/14 10:21:41 am: Sylvain Bougerel: PTW- not sure yet
19/2/14 10:38:16 am: Takashi Yoshida: @Pierre just sent the updated defect list.
19/2/14 10:39:05 am: Pierre Balthazar: Thanks
19/2/14 10:39:18 am: Stephanie Rendal: guys what is the password for operned? i was hoping to collect logs
19/2/14 10:40:07 am: Pierre Balthazar: Ask SBST
19/2/14 10:40:32 am: Sylvain Bougerel: (normally but you're not supposed to know:) operned191312
19/2/14 10:41:00 am: Stephanie Rendal: weekly wash was basically ok (i mean the whole cycle was performed automatically) but stabling table does not  validate and train window *blinks*
19/2/14 10:49:10 am: Stephanie Rendal: and also the wash plant status is not reset after completion of washing (stays at "WASH" status instead of "READY"), operator has to reset it manually.
19/2/14 10:51:14 am: Stephanie Rendal: all the above is true for both Daily and Weekly Wash. I think we should close weekly wash task and create new task(s) for these issues.
19/2/14 10:52:14 am: Sylvain Bougerel: Okay. Thanks Stephanie. Maybe that is what they mean when they say they can't wash as fast as before.
19/2/14 10:53:16 am: Stephanie Rendal: oh and for weekly wash, the pantograph down alarm is displayed and logged even though there is nothing wrong with the pantograph washing phase...
19/2/14 10:54:24 am: Stephanie Rendal: they can't wash as fast as before because the route is not set as fast as before. they were comparing to the previous one (without the new point and safety protection timer thing)
19/2/14 10:56:10 am: Sylvain Bougerel: Yes, but why does that impact the speed of wash? if it's not set as fast as before, does it matter so long as the route is set when the train is at the signal and the train don't need to stop?
19/2/14 10:56:25 am: Sylvain Bougerel: Maybe I misunderstand...
19/2/14 10:57:44 am: Stephanie Rendal: the wash is completed normally but the train stays there until the route is set. i think the speed of wash is normal. weekly is a bit long.
19/2/14 10:59:51 am: Stephanie Rendal: also since the stabling table is blank after the first washing i asked them to close it and reopen again and that refreshed the list to current status.before,they didnt do this so they couldnt see/validate succeeding trains (i guess they manually assigned them)
19/2/14 11:03:12 am: Stephanie Rendal: but there is definitely something wrong with the stabling table once a train is assigned to a wash mode.
19/2/14 11:03:34 am: Stephanie Rendal: anyway i have videos notes and logs
19/2/14 1:09:45 pm: Edgar Chong: Hi guys, I have already send out the method statement and the ITC test procedure.
19/2/14 1:15:09 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: @ Stephanie, I agree with your approach, please do as you stated.
19/2/14 1:28:45 pm: Pierre Balthazar: @ Sylvain & Andy. Jason is agreeable with our approach for the emulator. We can:
1. Demonstrate it works in factory
2. Test RTU-TDS on site
If doesn't work, we blame it to the RTU. 
Jason will speak to SBST.
19/2/14 1:30:48 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: @Arnaud(big), for the test with Depot, you are using the SWCsimu or modifying DI directly in the VDU of RTU SWC tables?
19/2/14 1:31:30 pm: Arnaud Roubaud: Modifying through vdu only
19/2/14 1:32:45 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Okay. Have you tried with SWCsimu? I think Jean-Louis knows how to do it.
19/2/14 1:33:23 pm: Arnaud Roubaud: Okay i'll ask jean louis
19/2/14 2:08:08 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: It would help us to prepare ourselves for TDS tests.
19/2/14 2:08:16 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Thanks
19/2/14 2:59:16 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Who can go for POW tests tonight at Depot?
20/2/14 3:47:49 am: Ming Hwee Tan: Tonight pre itc test is successful. All the switches are successful : monitoring of ocs/live status, remote/local status , open/close status.send control are tested succesful for non-live switches.mbcc fault from dccp2 is fixed by c759a.it is reported ok from inspector panel and schematics.the official pow itc starts on 21 Feb 2014 morning at 1am.
20/2/14 5:09:20 am: Jean-Louis Tang: So, wad went wrong?
C759a had a lot of pressure n fixed 'something' from their side (see below screenshot showing no more plc failure detected by mbcc).
From our side, last saturday feb, 15th, we used wrong DO addresses for our tests. Abb provided us the latest update in their very recent emails: we updated them on the spot and the send control of all new DS (except 2 of them that are on live) work like a charm.
As requested by Alvin, i should attend tonite's itc [21/02/2014 @ 1am] with c759a and abb.
20/2/14 5:10:45 am: Jean-Louis Tang: <media omitted>
20/2/14 6:35:45 am: Pierre Balthazar: Well done guys. Don't forget to brig the modifications to office and in our baseline
20/2/14 6:35:53 am: Pierre Balthazar: Congrats and thank you!
20/2/14 6:41:23 am: Sylvain Bougerel: That's really good. What would be a bonus is if Alvin has understood that the issue, this time, was not on our side.

Did you manage to sign some ITC docs? Or all to sign tomorrow?
20/2/14 11:20:05 am: Ming Hwee Tan: No documents is being signed. All will be signed tomorrow.
20/2/14 2:18:36 pm: ‪+65 9749 1446‬: sylvain@ meeting room EMR2
20/2/14 2:23:24 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: K
20/2/14 2:25:13 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Seems taken...
20/2/14 3:37:19 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Guys. Who's attending C752A interface meeting at 4?
I get weird info from everyone...
20/2/14 3:37:49 pm: Pierre Balthazar: I need to leave office now if it's confirmed and I need to be there
20/2/14 3:38:13 pm: Edgar Chong: I will be going too.
20/2/14 3:38:44 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Tingting just told me Andy is going
20/2/14 3:38:53 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Sylvain is I. HSO too
20/2/14 3:39:01 pm: Pierre Balthazar: So how? All of us?
20/2/14 3:40:25 pm: Edgar Chong: Andy going? If so, then I will prefer take in office to arrange tonight test.
20/2/14 3:41:32 pm: ‪+65 9749 1446‬: ok. i will be attending.
20/2/14 3:44:22 pm: ‪+65 9749 1446‬: myself n sylvain will be attending the ITC meeting @4pm
20/2/14 5:42:05 pm: Pierre Balthazar: How did the C752A meeting go?
20/2/14 6:22:06 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Several points where covered. Mostly, as a PM, you only need to know about future integration date (march 6) where we will proceed only with sector 8 regressions, then you would need to check with C752A about the train running profile tests: if we are not part of participants, they we can probably invoice someone. I will send the minutes tonight.
20/2/14 6:27:09 pm: Alexey Pakseykin: Not sure if it is true, but we may all end up facebooking...
http://www.businessinsider.sg/facebook-is-buying-whatsapp-2014-2/#.UwXYDnOwom8
20/2/14 6:29:00 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Previous meetings went okay. I need to send drawing updates urgently.
20/2/14 6:35:13 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: At the end of C752A meeting, Jason had a chat with us. Basically he is saying that Ibrahim himself told Koh Kai Neng that it had been a while that STC progress was flat, and since STC is not finished then we are not 100% commissioned. And since we are not fully commissioned then they could request for extention of DLP. Jason stresses that it's just an suggestion he made, but he was adamant to the lack of progress. Therefore Jason say we need to progress on this quickly, to which he added, therefore we need to grow the team to do so.

Looking at the last progress curve's shape, we really don't have much choice. Basically if we get into next monthly meeting without an action plan on this, we may be looking bad.
21/2/14 4:32:54 am: Ming Hwee Tan: Tonight itc test, we manage to test all DS switches and dccp2.For the ocs zones, only the stabling track ocs zones are tested. The rest of the ocs zones will only be tested on the power on test . Although still needs to be tested on power on day, all 3 tests are already signed.
21/2/14 4:42:36 am: Ming Hwee Tan: We decide to revert the schematics in case SBST decides to do something funny. They need someone on power on day to start the new power schematics.
21/2/14 4:53:28 am: Ming Hwee Tan: Observations found: events/alarm are shown for existing ds but the new ds does not show alarm/events at depot. The schematics equipment label from depot is not blinking but the schematics equipment label from occ is blinking.
21/2/14 7:05:49 am: Marc Oliver Castañeda: @sylvain when you talk about stc progress this is phase 1 right?
21/2/14 8:49:05 am: Arnaud Roubaud: Hi guys... I will be late today. I should at the office around 10:30
21/2/14 8:57:06 am: Pierre Balthazar: Well done on the tests last night. Just got a call from Tingting though. Did we follow the method statement accurately for restarting CMS servers?
21/2/14 8:57:40 am: Pierre Balthazar: Apparently there's some issue with the delegation table
21/2/14 9:06:19 am: Takashi Yoshida: Were we allowed to restart CMS? I was under the impression that we didn't have mainline possession.
21/2/14 9:07:03 am: Pierre Balthazar: Apparently we had to in order to update the power db
21/2/14 9:07:26 am: Takashi Yoshida: @Marc, I'm pretty sure  Sylvain means phase 1.
21/2/14 9:15:11 am: Sylvain Bougerel: @Marc, Correct.
@ others, yes PFR controls required the same modification as the one applied the night before to DCS.
@delegation, delegation: you suck. since delegation has been that way since cut-over, I don't think tonight's issue with delegation is specific to our tests. Probably just another delegation issue.
21/2/14 9:16:01 am: Sylvain Bougerel: It does seems like there is an increase in delegation problems since 5th Jan release, though.
21/2/14 9:17:36 am: Takashi Yoshida: Need to check if our fix is already deployed for delegation. Though an issue with delegation doesn't tell us much.
21/2/14 9:42:43 am: Sylvain Bougerel: We can discuss it more later.
21/2/14 9:50:55 am: Takashi Yoshida: Ok, my bad. The fix isn't there because we rejected this issue. We couldn't reproduce it in factory.
21/2/14 9:52:52 am: Takashi Yoshida: There's a note in JIRA that Andy saw this happen when ATS is started without waiting for CMS to start completely. But he's not sure if this always happen like that.
21/2/14 12:40:23 pm: Jean-Louis Tang: Btw, the EVariable.dat file is updated on tds (both cms and ned) for the new DS in sector 10.
21/2/14 12:56:51 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Was it updated in the package? Not yet, right?
21/2/14 1:30:07 pm: Jean-Louis Tang: Nope, i will do it thru the configurator on mon.
21/2/14 1:43:04 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Okay.

24/2/14 2:16:22 pm: ‪+65 9749 1446‬: i can handle, no problem. they will discuss on the phase 1 ITC outstanding test, PIS lib download issue and phase 2 test n installation activities.
24/2/14 2:28:56 pm: ‪+65 9749 1446‬: opps, i think i have mixed up with the ITC at 5pm. Ting Ting has just call me and told me they are having another ITC at 2pm. btw I'm going to LTA nw.
25/2/14 1:58:49 pm: Imran bin Omar: Below from Tingting posted in NEL C755A WA grp...
hi Edgar, as spoken, SBST informed that PFR encountered "no active DBS server" when they try to generate monthly report. Please send someone to troubleshoot on site. They need to generate the monthly report on Friday midnight.
25/2/14 1:59:26 pm: Imran bin Omar: Wondering 
.... Is there no SBST maintenance team to troubleshoot first?
25/2/14 2:00:22 pm: Imran bin Omar: At least they can check if active DBS server is running...
25/2/14 2:24:33 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Yes there is, but obviously they fail. So they call us, just because they can, since our system is not fully commissioned.
25/2/14 2:25:23 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Btw, Pierre, I had Issac on the phone, he talked about meeting a little earlier before the meeting tomorrow. Did he spoke to you?
25/2/14 2:31:04 pm: Mohamed Rozaini: Faced similar issue over the weekend for SER and PGL. GWS log showed Operation Failed when trying to subscribe to DBS state. Reason: GroupDescription
25/2/14 2:31:26 pm: Mohamed Rozaini: DBS env running during occurence
25/2/14 2:36:06 pm: Edgar Chong: Based on tingting info, FWC able to generate report. It looks like pfr is same issue Rozaini encounter at SER & PGL.
25/2/14 2:37:03 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Ok. So they can have the reports for end of the month. Correct?
25/2/14 2:40:08 pm: Edgar Chong: Yes, there's a work around. If the problem is what encounter at SER & PGL.
25/2/14 2:40:51 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Please check. If they do have a way to generate reports we do not go onsite
25/2/14 2:48:08 pm: Imran bin Omar: Pierre, also let me know if need to get Ong GK our SA consultant, for the RDT presentation depending on whether LTA SA team is available tomorrow.
25/2/14 5:28:02 pm: Imran bin Omar: @ Pierre, msg below from Ong on the RDT presentation at LTA tomorrow:
My colleague Kum Thong will do that. No worries. The RDT is quite straight forward. Cheers!

27/2/14 1:07:46 pm: Stephanie Rendal: Hi guys, i'll be in the office by 2pm
28/2/14 2:21:47 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Hi Edgar & Andy, just for you to note. As part of HBF overrun works, we have to participate in a sump pump test on the 24th of May 2014 with C713. They are simply exchanging an old sump pump with a new one, and need to make sure it still works. No change on our side, just assist with tests.
28/2/14 2:32:20 pm: Ming Hwee Tan: Pis library download test fails.From HMi, we saw "Download msg OK" then it changes to "Download file NOK".From rad log, it is observed that the message is being sent but the end of message is not found.
28/2/14 2:32:39 pm: Ming Hwee Tan: I already collected the logs.

5/3/14 12:58:09 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Sure we can. But ScsEnvTable is probably not replaced during the installation so the existing high trace levels might remain in effect.

8/3/14 8:13:54 pm: Takashi Yoshida: And someone from test team has the method statement with him?
8/3/14 8:15:58 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Actually i also have the simple user manual for the new crystal reports. I intensed to leAve a copy at site. @ takashi do u have a printer? I can scan the doc and email to u
8/3/14 8:16:56 pm: Alexey Pakseykin: The only thing which is special for today is unzipping directory structure. Plus new UI to print report (which should be highlighted by to one operator). OK. Marc can give details.
8/3/14 8:17:48 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Sorry. I have no printer with me.
8/3/14 8:18:11 pm: Takashi Yoshida: You can still email it to me though. takashi@takashiyoshida.org
8/3/14 8:18:13 pm: Alexey Pakseykin: Laptop with mobility?
8/3/14 8:18:33 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Nope.
8/3/14 8:33:53 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: Hi guys,
I have the M.S. With me and the directory structure!
8/3/14 8:34:56 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: Let's meet there at 12:15, FYI, all the packages are deployed and ready to be installed.
8/3/14 8:35:27 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Tingting said meet at 12:00 am.
8/3/14 8:36:32 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Hi takashi i sent to ur email. Thanks

8/3/14 8:45:12 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: Anyways we'll not be allowed to start before..
8/3/14 8:52:28 pm: Edgar Chong: Please meet at 12am as mentioned by Tingting. She want to discuss on the procedure for tonight work.
8/3/14 8:57:47 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: Alright
8/3/14 9:01:36 pm: Takashi Yoshida: @Marc, what is the oracle DB password? 'bdhis'?
8/3/14 9:03:30 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Yes, but operator should know this already
8/3/14 9:04:29 pm: Takashi Yoshida: I'm asking just in case.
8/3/14 9:04:40 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Thanks.
8/3/14 11:35:37 pm: Takashi Yoshida: On my way
8/3/14 11:58:56 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Who else is coming tonight? Got anyone else with no EPIC?
8/3/14 11:59:18 pm: Ming Hwee Tan: Me
8/3/14 11:59:32 pm: Takashi Yoshida: OK
8/3/14 11:59:53 pm: Ming Hwee Tan: Just tell them from thales
9/3/14 12:00:27 am: Takashi Yoshida: My name isn't on the list so I need to sign in with the duty  officer
9/3/14 12:07:58 am: Nimesh Chauhan: Me in 2min
9/3/14 2:48:21 am: Takashi Yoshida: Nimesh, let us know when you update GWS at CNT and OTP.
9/3/14 2:49:41 am: Nimesh Chauhan: All right
9/3/14 3:28:10 am: Nimesh Chauhan: Otp station finished. .. now going to cnt station
9/3/14 3:39:43 am: Ming Hwee Tan: Message me once u arw done
9/3/14 4:11:00 am: Nimesh Chauhan: Cnt station finished
..waiting for sm to perform some test. ...but currently he went to platform downstairs
9/3/14 4:23:33 am: Nimesh Chauhan: Test at cnt done
9/3/14 4:25:54 am: Ming Hwee Tan: Ok.i already transfer the required files.
9/3/14 12:53:15 pm: Takashi Yoshida: (Partial) recap of last night:
- train CCTV test failed with 4412 errors
- ATAS test caused both CMS to crash

After restarting CMS, both tests passed. 

CNT, OTP: VNC does not work and must physically go there to update GWS. 

FWC sees some ISCS RTU comm fault status. Limited to some stations only.
- see the screenshots (later)
- RTU log shows new connection and disconnection being made (I don't have copies of RTU logs; There are local copy at OCC but DO was unable to make copy for me)

Updating DBS takes long time because of backup. One file is 7.7GB and old packages are still there.
9/3/14 12:53:24 pm: Takashi Yoshida: <media omitted>
9/3/14 1:02:06 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Let's discuss tomorrow. I've got tons of questions popping in my head right now!
9/3/14 1:02:23 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Thanks for the update. Enjoy your Sunday afternoon!
9/3/14 1:03:15 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Thanks a lot for volunteering Takashi and everyone for the work.
9/3/14 1:04:30 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Indeed !
9/3/14 1:09:00 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: ECS controller coms status is the OTIS lift/escalators controller, if I am not wrong. I experienced once that after RTU or server restart, it does not reconnect to PLC. Generally the fault is cleared by restarting the controller itself (SBST maintenance team ) I would not care so much about it, since it is not "our ECS". it should be SBST issue.  8-) 

I don't know what is CWS.
9/3/14 1:44:45 pm: Mohamed Rozaini: @Sylvain, CWS belongs to COMMS, its the the workstation for the PIS
9/3/14 1:48:04 pm: Mohamed Rozaini: The ECS controller is not OTIS one, they are the LSC for the ECS eqpt. normally not an ISCS issue
9/3/14 2:04:57 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: So I was wrong. Thanks for correcting me ;-)
10/3/14 9:12:35 am: Sylvain Bougerel: There is no more issue with the power "line"  being purple? Did they make a mistake (forgetting to open a breaker or DS somewhere)?
10/3/14 6:11:10 pm: Nimesh Chauhan: Hi sylvain.  As in today's meeting Chu duc. ..mentioned to let it running for tonight. ...and to retrieve by tomorrow.
10/3/14 6:13:24 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Who's supposed to go on site tonight? (If anyone)
10/3/14 6:23:27 pm: Edgar Chong: Tingting called me, saying that sbst are very concern on the DS showing purple even when they open the circuit. They have pple going down to site to check if the power is it off today. And PFR said they have problem with the power report.
10/3/14 6:24:07 pm: Edgar Chong: So she want us to go down to troubleshoot on these including the ECS issue.
10/3/14 6:27:38 pm: Edgar Chong: She requested someone from software side to check on the issue. Nimesh will be going down to collect the logs based on the method statement. Can someone from software side able to go down today?
10/3/14 6:28:35 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Is there any other reason for Nimesh to go down than tingting's request?
10/3/14 6:30:31 pm: Edgar Chong: Yes. We actually set a trace to troubleshoot on the power report and in the method statement it mentioned that we will collect today and revert back the trace level on dbs server.
10/3/14 6:33:44 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Ok. We're not doing anything which not in the method statement. I hope this is crystal clear for everyone.
10/3/14 7:04:03 pm: Takashi Yoshida: So am I correct to understand that no developer will set his/her feet into SBST's ground tonight?
10/3/14 7:04:51 pm: Pierre Balthazar: You're correct
10/3/14 7:05:31 pm: Pierre Balthazar: If Tingting has any problem with that. She can call me. Any time!
10/3/14 7:09:11 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: Is someone going?
10/3/14 7:10:44 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Nimesh. As per initial plan (follow up from yesterday)
10/3/14 7:11:00 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: Ok
10/3/14 8:18:02 pm: Takashi Yoshida: @Pierre, Tingting asked me if I can provide instructions for checking database (for power schematics issue) so that Nimesh can instruct SBST TO to perform the checking. Would that be allowed?
10/3/14 9:01:54 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Honestly I don't think we have been communicating very well on this. A little more reactivity would have gone a long way to cool off the situation. I find it disappointing that no one answered Ting Ting on that the whole day...
10/3/14 9:03:22 pm: Pierre Balthazar: @Takashi. Yes of course we can advise. But we are not taking responsibility: it would bite us back
10/3/14 9:03:50 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Ok, thanks. I'll call Nimesh in a bit.
10/3/14 9:03:55 pm: Pierre Balthazar: @Sylvain: I agree. But I personally only got to know about this ard 5pm when I receive and email from her
10/3/14 9:04:27 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: It was there for everyone to read on whatsapp since yesterday.
10/3/14 9:05:12 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Sorry didn't mean to bash anyone... Just a bit disappointed that's all.
10/3/14 9:05:58 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Power schematics was only reported at 2:54 am this morning. I'll admit that our response wasn't fast, but we also had our own meetings to process.
10/3/14 9:06:09 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Yes it was. As an RTU issue. I understand there's another whatsapp group involving NWRP people. But I'm not on this one
10/3/14 9:07:13 pm: Pierre Balthazar: I agree with Sylvain regarding communication. Both internally and with the customer. Let's do damage control now!
10/3/14 9:07:22 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Sorry, I did not check exact time. It was there since I woke up - - I assume yesterday. I know you had the meeting. Maybe I ask too much.
11/3/14 2:38:25 am: Nimesh Chauhan: Hi all.
1.The good news is that the purple colour power issue for the bgk and hgn didn't occurred. It funcuntioned normal when the pfr performed putting off the ocs breakers and it shows black line.
Any way we did a double check into the scsbrowser and checklist is passed. 

2. I found that the trace lever has been set to the non running dbs ie. neldbs2a. 
So today i have set to the correct running neldbs1a and need to unset the trace after 2 days.

Regards
Nimesh

12/3/14 11:31:22 am: Takashi Yoshida: @Nimesh, did you collect logs on Tuesday morning?
13/3/14 4:00:28 pm: Edgar Chong: Who is coming for the interface meeting with C760A? It's at EMR1
13/3/14 4:03:14 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Okay. Thanks
14/3/14 2:21:22 pm: Ming Hwee Tan: Anyone knows how we ensure that wake up call is being sent to tci during the train wake up?
14/3/14 2:23:53 pm: Ming Hwee Tan: I mean how do iscs ensure tci sends the wake up command to iscs?
14/3/14 2:25:04 pm: Ming Hwee Tan: Can it be verify from the radio manager?
14/3/14 2:25:12 pm: Nimesh Chauhan: If their is yellow line at the bottom of the train hmi
14/3/14 2:26:10 pm: Stephanie Rendal: it can be seen in the inspector panel also
14/3/14 2:26:27 pm: Nimesh Chauhan: It can also be checked at launching table
14/3/14 2:26:56 pm: Ming Hwee Tan: Which status?
14/3/14 2:27:09 pm: Stephanie Rendal: readiness state i think
14/3/14 2:29:22 pm: Ming Hwee Tan: Is the readiness state a good indication? I think it only indicates the eventual state.not the command from  tci.
14/3/14 2:30:14 pm: Stephanie Rendal: train readiness mode: auto will show wake up if its just recently woken up, then it will change to depot movement or mainline or something
14/3/14 2:30:30 pm: Stephanie Rendal: oh wait
14/3/14 2:31:01 pm: Ming Hwee Tan: Yes.that is the end result.
14/3/14 2:31:05 pm: Stephanie Rendal: you want to check if the command is sent successfully?
14/3/14 2:31:45 pm: Stephanie Rendal: im not sure about that. logs?
14/3/14 2:33:34 pm: Ming Hwee Tan: I want to know if tci (radio) sends sends (71) tell call command or (72).can these be seen from gws other than logs?
14/3/14 2:34:08 pm: Stephanie Rendal: oh i don't know about that
14/3/14 2:34:18 pm: Ming Hwee Tan: Ok
14/3/14 2:43:02 pm: Ming Hwee Tan: So I can safely say the exchange for tci commands during train wake up will not be shown from the HMI other than the eventual readiness state?
14/3/14 2:44:07 pm: Stephanie Rendal: i can't answer this i'll ask ming wah
14/3/14 2:44:34 pm: Ming Hwee Tan: Ok.
14/3/14 2:46:26 pm: Stephanie Rendal: Ok ming wah says
14/3/14 2:46:27 pm: Stephanie Rendal: Yes
14/3/14 2:46:42 pm: Ming Hwee Tan: Ok
14/3/14 2:46:58 pm: Ming Hwee Tan: Thats what I think too.
14/3/14 4:23:26 pm: Ming Wah Tham: Hi Stephanie, SBST Chief Controller said H5 and Test Track are not auto-COE areas.
14/3/14 4:26:47 pm: Stephanie Rendal: ok thanks ming wah. axel also replied and said both ends of the new test track (tt2) are both auto coe. also, the four tracks i mentioned are actually not sidings.
14/3/14 5:01:08 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Sorry I completely overlooked the conversation about the TCI. Ming-Hwee, to be precise, the only way to confirm the TCI command has been sent is through the Rad logs. HMI would not give that confirmation from integration stand point.
14/3/14 5:01:45 pm: Ming Wah Tham: I see. It's really good to get confirmation from Signalling, isn't it? Saves us a lot of mistakes and guessing.
14/3/14 5:08:09 pm: Ming Hwee Tan: Yes.we will only display the eventual readiness mode which ia wakeup.
15/3/14 12:49:00 am: Arnaud Esbelin: Hi guys,
I've an issue on trsgws2a configuration.
At the end of the installation, I received two error msg mentioning ODBC and Oracle issue...
Please see the following
15/3/14 12:49:27 am: Arnaud Esbelin: <media omitted>
15/3/14 12:49:59 am: Arnaud Esbelin: <media omitted>
15/3/14 12:51:49 am: Alexey Pakseykin: Maybe Oracle client is not installed.
Can you show screenshot of "Add and remove programs" list in Control Panel?
15/3/14 12:55:59 am: Arnaud Esbelin: <media omitted>
15/3/14 12:56:28 am: Arnaud Esbelin: Oracle client was installed on this machine, but it looks like some files are missing...
15/3/14 12:57:13 am: Arnaud Esbelin: The bad news is that I don't have Oracle installer with me...
15/3/14 12:58:16 am: Alexey Pakseykin: Hmm... I don't see it in the list.  It will be embarrassing if others see it.
15/3/14 1:00:37 am: Arnaud Esbelin: I will shutdown the gws anyway, we'll fix it next time by installing Oracle again...
15/3/14 1:01:07 am: Arnaud Esbelin: Why this issue is happening only now after few updates already on TDS...
15/3/14 1:06:59 am: Sylvain Bougerel: Which GWS gives the problem? Have you tried with others? I know the one closest to the door should work since we installed it with Oracle last December.
15/3/14 1:08:05 am: Sylvain Bougerel: Sorry, I should say, since we configured it last December. It was already installed, and I went on site to make sure they were running.
15/3/14 1:08:53 am: Sylvain Bougerel: Oracle is obviously not in the list though... Damn
15/3/14 1:10:24 am: Sylvain Bougerel: Btw, if you just press OK,  does the installation continue?
15/3/14 1:15:51 am: Arnaud Esbelin: Ok this is trsgws2a the one on the left at the front row
15/3/14 1:16:42 am: Arnaud Esbelin: When I press ok the installation finish and I managed to start the application but with a lot of error msgs and a bad display of the interface
15/3/14 1:17:01 am: Arnaud Esbelin: Without the toolbar at the bottom for example
15/3/14 1:17:51 am: Sylvain Bougerel: Yes I remember the same issue on this one! That's the one I did not manage to finish the configuration. Try the one on the right instead
15/3/14 1:18:09 am: Arnaud Esbelin: I also agree On the fact that Oracle was maybe the first software to be installed on the machine, so it should work,
But who knows what's going on in this room
15/3/14 1:18:40 am: Arnaud Esbelin: Check this out, how I've found trsgws3a when reaching the place:
15/3/14 1:19:01 am: Arnaud Esbelin: <media omitted>
15/3/14 1:19:31 am: Sylvain Bougerel: lol
15/3/14 1:19:34 am: Sylvain Bougerel: Wao
15/3/14 1:19:38 am: Arnaud Esbelin: The two other gws are updated and are able to run properly
15/3/14 1:20:09 am: Arnaud Esbelin: I've put a coment on the M.S. Regarding the one failing
15/3/14 1:20:16 am: Sylvain Bougerel: Good.
15/3/14 1:20:31 am: Arnaud Esbelin: It's signed by LTA, will investigate later..
15/3/14 1:20:45 am: Arnaud Esbelin: We'll*
15/3/14 1:21:06 am: Sylvain Bougerel: K
16/3/14 10:05:26 am: Ming Hwee Tan: Pre itc test fail. All sig equipment are blue. From the scs_log, a lot of unknown status are found. We try to test the server and db version from the fat but all sig equipment still blue.we also have problem starting both servers.the standby can't start properly . During rtu revert, the rtu version that is used is different from the on site rtu version.so LTA don't allow us to leave rtu online.After all trains have completely launched, we manage to get the download file from the on site rtu and start up both rtu.both ned server are started too.we manage to revert to the conditions before the test.
16/3/14 10:06:20 am: Ming Hwee Tan: The logs are also collected.
16/3/14 10:22:10 am: Sylvain Bougerel: I am very sorry to hear you had so much trouble during the test. Let's try to have a bit of a group chat on Monday to figure out what could have happened and brainstorm for some way forward before the next possession. Thanks a lot for hanging on through that night. I hope the next one will be better.
16/3/14 10:25:35 am: Pierre Balthazar: Thanks for all the efforts guys. And sorry to hear that. 
Quick question: when we say the RTU version on site is different from the one we wanted to revert it to, does it mean we didn't bring the good version to revert or does it mean the version on site was changed without us knowing?
16/3/14 10:25:58 am: Pierre Balthazar: Agree with Sylvain. Let's have a group chat on mondy
16/3/14 10:27:51 am: Sylvain Bougerel: We will check in the office with the configuration from site collected by Ming-Hwee , but I fear that we simply forgot to bump the version number in our source control.
16/3/14 10:28:37 am: Pierre Balthazar: Me too. Just want to be sure :-)
16/3/14 10:30:52 am: Ming Hwee Tan: Yes and since the version we reverted is the official version number which differs from the site version (manually updated), they didn't allow us to leave it on.
16/3/14 10:55:11 am: Chi-Duc Duong: Not only the version number is different. Some SWC tables have different address too. Not sure if these have been integrated with the Phase 2 download files
16/3/14 11:20:37 am: Sylvain Bougerel: Ah. That's not good then. There should be no modification of existing tables. Only new ones added for sector 10... Let's not speculate and see on Monday
17/3/14 2:46:34 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Anybody remember signing C751C program rev. C? I certainly didn't...
17/3/14 2:47:08 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: It was submitted last Friday.
17/3/14 2:53:23 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Ming Hwee did after calling me. But I thought it was rev. B
17/3/14 2:54:35 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Now they say rev C. Apparently they cannot get their revision straight...
17/3/14 2:55:05 pm: Ming Hwee Tan: It was for rev c.all swc sign the document after rev b.
17/3/14 2:55:32 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Okay. Alright, that's clear then
17/3/14 2:55:51 pm: Ming Hwee Tan: According to them, it is only minor changes.
18/3/14 3:14:33 pm: Alexey Pakseykin: FYI: I will be on SPF/Cubicon site today whole night until 9AM and be absent from office tomorrow. Let me know if I need to prepare anything before meeting on Thursday.
18/3/14 3:32:04 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Wow. Good luck. Have a good rest
18/3/14 3:32:15 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: the next day
19/3/14 4:51:00 am: Arnaud Esbelin: <media omitted>
19/3/14 4:57:32 am: Sylvain Bougerel: Summary of tonight's test on RTU in chronology. Arnd 2:30, isolate RTU2, put new rom on RTU1: fail. Then put new config on RTU1 with new rom: fail. Then put new config with old rom: fail. Then revert everything... still fail! It took around 10+ long minutes for the connection to come back, and we have no idea why it took so long. We now worry that the regular reconfiguration did not, in fact allow enough time for us to confirm that other configuration were working.

Overall, tonight's tests are another failure.
19/3/14 8:13:50 am: Takashi Yoshida: I remember it can take quite long time for the schematics to update during the STC. Other than looking at the schematics, is there anyway to see if the ROM actually failed or succeeded?
19/3/14 1:02:12 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Regrettably, not much. RTU logs are really not helpful... maybe it's time we put back all these debug statement in the rom
19/3/14 1:06:13 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Something I forgot to say about yesterday, the way forward is that we are going to try to work with C752A next. There are some puzzling things. I refuse to believe that some of the configuration above did not work, you guys did everything right: It *should* have worked.

What I am trying to say is: there is a chance that something is a bit broken on DMS side, that prevents us to see our tests working.
19/3/14 1:14:17 pm: Pierre Balthazar: I hope you're right!!!
19/3/14 5:22:25 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Hi guys. Live piece of news: C752A will be ready for AM tests by mid-April. So it's our target to finish regression tests.
19/3/14 5:23:33 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: @Jean-Louis did you update the IDD with new values for C759A interfaces?
19/3/14 6:40:03 pm: Jean-Louis Tang: I already updated the idd, yes but not submitted yet as lta will advise how to handle the document in the case of a update further to a fcdd status.
20/3/14 8:48:05 am: ‪+65 9749 1446‬: hi guys, i will be going to the tsit meeting at alstom this morning.
20/3/14 8:52:01 am: Ming Hwee Tan: See you
20/3/14 9:08:39 am: Pierre Balthazar: Guys. Meeting has been postponed to this afternoon. 2--4pm Alstom @ Starhub Green
20/3/14 9:10:12 am: Ming Hwee Tan: Ok.nevermind.i just come back to office
20/3/14 9:17:03 am: Takashi Yoshida: Tech meeting is postponed?
20/3/14 9:18:11 am: Alexey Pakseykin: Only alstom meeting is postponed (according to email I saw).
20/3/14 9:20:59 am: Takashi Yoshida: Jason just called about delegation issue this morning. SBST began restarting SMS env (one at a time) from 5 AM, but each restart takes about 15-20 min, supposedly due to archiving and deletion of logs and events. They've only managed to restart 4 SMS.
20/3/14 9:21:48 am: Pierre Balthazar: And?
20/3/14 9:22:22 am: Takashi Yoshida: Jason wants to know if we made any changes recently.
20/3/14 9:24:08 am: Takashi Yoshida: I said no but he asked me to look into it. I remember we enabled some collection of events(?) due to alarm desync issue before but I don't remember any adverse effects from it.
20/3/14 9:24:13 am: Pierre Balthazar: Have we? I don't think so... But you guys need to confirm that
20/3/14 9:24:43 am: Takashi Yoshida: So is the tech meeting still at 10:30? I just want to confirm.
20/3/14 9:25:27 am: Pierre Balthazar: Yes it is
20/3/14 9:27:11 am: Takashi Yoshida: Ok, thanks. I'll be on my way soon.
20/3/14 9:30:38 am: Takashi Yoshida: @Jean-Louis, at one point (possibly long time ago), I remember you added some process to collect events(alarms?). Can you look into this issue?
20/3/14 9:39:46 am: Takashi Yoshida: When does the archiving and deletion of events/alarms take place? Before or after we begin to write logs? Will there be any useful info in the log?
20/3/14 9:49:47 am: Takashi Yoshida: Did anyone notice this issue during the pre-ITC? Tingting mentioned this also happened during the pre-ITC.
20/3/14 9:53:10 am: Chi-Duc Duong: Yes, I noticed this during the test on Sunday but for the first time we restarted the DCS. Subsequent starts seemed ok maybe because logs had been backed up after the first start
20/3/14 10:03:30 am: Takashi Yoshida: I think so.
20/3/14 10:29:56 am: Jean-Louis Tang: I activated 2 processes to get both alarm n event logs. Every time the environment starts, it will clean n backup these small files. So if there are a lot of these small files, it will take time yes to do the job. As we are not reported abt alarm desync issue and if we think these logfiles are not needed, we can disable them in scsenvtable.
20/3/14 10:42:34 am: Takashi Yoshida: Ok, thanks.
20/3/14 10:58:48 am: Takashi Yoshida: If we disable the processes, will cleaning also stop when we start the SMS? Or do we need to stop nel_start.sh (or some other shell scripts) from cleaning the files?
20/3/14 11:26:17 am: Sylvain Bougerel: Are we really sure there are no more desync? Or is it just that we worked around it so well that it does not cause problems at the moment...
20/3/14 11:27:34 am: Takashi Yoshida: There's probably going to be desync if we remove the workaround.
20/3/14 11:27:56 am: Sylvain Bougerel: Is there a solution that involves not having to choose between "keep the logs but slow start" and "no log but fast start".
20/3/14 11:29:05 am: Takashi Yoshida: Maybe Jean-Louis can advise on something better than what we have now.
20/3/14 11:31:37 am: Alexey Pakseykin: What about recycling the logs? If there is a job which cleans old files, these logs should be covered.
20/3/14 12:33:45 pm: Jean-Louis Tang: Well, currently during sms life, the process checks periodically if the size of the generated log files exceeds 100mb(configurable). If yes, it will tar/zip n clean these logs. Each log is abt 2kb eg the dynamic clean up occurs when there are abt 50000 files. I am thinking of how to optimize. The time being i can suggest u to set the max size of the total log files to 1 or 2 mb (500 or 1000 files), maybe the optimization may be slightly better as workarnd for now?
20/3/14 1:03:11 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: What takes a long time, is the listing of the inodes. The size of file does not really matter. Hence, we could tar (not necessarily zip) immediately the newly produced log into the current tar. That makes only 1 log file, 1 tar file, and the archives, which would reduce the size of inode a lot.
20/3/14 1:03:54 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Addendum : would reduce the number of inode a lot
20/3/14 1:10:19 pm: Alexey Pakseykin: Another approach can cover all logs tarring in general: move logs (takes nothing) and tar them in background nicely (with `nice` command).
20/3/14 1:39:46 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Jason called again to inform me about CMS went down again (last night and just now). Apparently, ATS is also somehow affected (though not a crash). He (as LTA) is requesting a developer to go and have a look and collect logs.
20/3/14 1:47:33 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Just texted him. Wait a bit before any action
20/3/14 7:11:00 pm: Pierre Balthazar: @Arnaud & Takashi. Any prelim findings?
20/3/14 7:11:27 pm: Takashi Yoshida: I'm sending one now via emails.
20/3/14 7:11:40 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Ok. Thanks
20/3/14 7:12:17 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Btw. No meeting with Koh tomorrow morning. No meeting.
20/3/14 7:12:32 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Ok, cool.
20/3/14 7:12:57 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Do you need to go back on site tonight?
20/3/14 7:14:01 pm: Takashi Yoshida: David is requesting for one person via Tingting. Maybe she'll call you?
20/3/14 7:14:46 pm: Pierre Balthazar: She did. I said: thank you for invitation. I'll tell you if it's required.
20/3/14 7:14:49 pm: Pierre Balthazar: :-)
20/3/14 7:14:57 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Is it required?
20/3/14 7:16:12 pm: Pierre Balthazar: From our perspective of course
20/3/14 7:19:16 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Not a lot of benefit, I think. Ensuring they do a proper start of servers and delegation may be useful for our future. Otherwise, just scoring some points from LTA.
20/3/14 7:20:24 pm: Takashi Yoshida: DMSE issue is still a mystery but maybe we just need more time with logs.
20/3/14 7:26:07 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Look into the logs for line such as "skipped watchdog"...
20/3/14 7:26:37 pm: Takashi Yoshida: From CMS, or ATS?
20/3/14 7:26:44 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: maybe not skipped but "delayed watchdog"
20/3/14 7:26:46 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: ATS
20/3/14 7:27:04 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Ok, thanks
20/3/14 7:28:02 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: If you see a duration for more that 15 seconds, then it means that we skipped the 3 x 5 seconds heartbeat to DMS
20/3/14 7:28:22 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: in this case DMS goes Emergency mode (so called DMSE)
20/3/14 7:29:07 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: now if you find that, check if right above these lines you have a Corba communication issue with one of the OCC services
20/3/14 7:29:26 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: I am home so it's a bit on top of my head all this.
20/3/14 7:29:45 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Ok, will do.
20/3/14 7:29:47 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: But the principal is sound.... Good luck.
20/3/14 7:30:20 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: * I meant one of the CMS services
20/3/14 7:31:39 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Can someone forward my last mail to LTA? Especially Tingting (assuming that's good enough).
20/3/14 7:34:38 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Will forward. After reading ;-)
20/3/14 7:54:46 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Done
20/3/14 7:55:01 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Ok, thanks.
20/3/14 7:55:24 pm: Pierre Balthazar: I've CC'ed everyone from your email so you know what I've told them
20/3/14 8:03:08 pm: Ming Wah Tham: Hi Takashi, following from Sylvain's text, ATS misses the watchdog due to two common reasons: 1. Too busy in traffic cycle (too many trains); 2. It is blocked either by CMS or the database.
If u see Corba error, it  suggests that a CORBA call to CMS (like database read or a cross-env function call) has failed. It is usually a consequence of a CMS blockage (or failure) affecting the ATS. Constipation!!!! 😓
20/3/14 8:08:59 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Ok, thanks. I'm leaving OCC now so I'll look at the logs tomorrow. Didn't see any obvious "delay", "skip" or "watchdog" so far though.
20/3/14 8:09:46 pm: Ming Wah Tham: Should be in the scs_logs of ATS.
20/3/14 8:10:05 pm: Ming Wah Tham: Sorry, should be tmc_logs.
20/3/14 8:14:10 pm: Takashi Yoshida: We'll, that explains why.
20/3/14 8:27:22 pm: Pierre Balthazar: ⚠️⚠️⚠️ Bad news of the night: mr. Koh instruct us to go onsite tonight to "show commitment". I need a volunteer please. And if possible someone who can answer some questions...
20/3/14 8:29:39 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Are they difficult questions?
20/3/14 8:30:03 pm: Alexey Pakseykin: The same question.
20/3/14 8:30:07 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Ha ha ha. I hope not. But who knows...
20/3/14 8:32:15 pm: Takashi Yoshida: I can go, if the questions are difficult, do I have the right to remain silent?
20/3/14 8:32:51 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Of course. I would even advise to do so ;-)
20/3/14 8:33:04 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Yee sen will be there on NWRP side
20/3/14 8:33:13 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Thanks a lot Takashi
20/3/14 8:34:05 pm: Ming Wah Tham: Takashi, rent a room at the OCC and stay there. 😅
20/3/14 8:35:27 pm: Takashi Yoshida: If I ever voluntarily rent a room there, you have my permission to shoot me in the head.
20/3/14 8:37:16 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Do I need to stick around until 6 am? Or can I go when the tests are done?
20/3/14 8:37:46 pm: Ming Wah Tham: Beats leaving the OCC and looping back again in a matter of hours.
20/3/14 8:38:16 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Escape as soon as you can. My take is tests only
20/3/14 8:38:41 pm: Takashi Yoshida: I'll prepare my jet pack then.
20/3/14 8:39:21 pm: Ming Wah Tham: Jet pack is not claimable. Taxi is. 😆
20/3/14 8:46:06 pm: Ming Hwee Tan: By the way, based on what the duty TO mention on the first day of pre itc, the problem may not be just pertaining to CMS or ATS.They have been seeing sms servers stopping by themselves. I have helped them restart at least 3 servers.
20/3/14 8:47:24 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Thanks, good to know. They've never mentioned that today.
20/3/14 9:26:16 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Stanley is going on site for testing tonight! Do we really need to send yet 1 more guy!?
20/3/14 9:26:49 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Is he? I thought he was going to one tomorrow.
20/3/14 9:27:01 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Or am I completely mistaken? Isn't there COM tests tonight?
20/3/14 9:27:04 pm: Stanley Lim: I am going tomorrow in the afternoon
20/3/14 9:27:14 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Ahhhhhhh right
20/3/14 9:27:22 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Sorry, mistake.
20/3/14 9:53:13 pm: Takashi Yoshida: We were about to fail to show commitment. Hahaha!
21/3/14 1:23:06 am: Takashi Yoshida: 00:32 CMS2(standby) started
00:36 CMS2 started completely; scsimgdump shows less than 2 secs difference; 

We proceed with checking the delegation tables at TC1, CC and TC2 (all same)

Start running ATAS tests at TC1 GWS (msg ID 204, 205, 206, 207, 200 and 303) with train 937 at PGL

Repeat tests with CC and TC2 GWS

All ATAS tests successful without any CMS crash

Tests completed before 1:00 AM.

Ok I'll send it to you.
21/3/14 3:24:07 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Thanks!
21/3/14 3:41:35 pm: Takashi Yoshida: At this stage in SIG pre-ITC, do we need trains? Yee Sen is trying to get possession on 23 or 24.
21/3/14 3:49:24 pm: Edgar Chong: Train will only be needed if the non regression can proceed.
21/3/14 3:52:41 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Do you think we can get C752A to help us earlier (23 or 24)? Without their help, do you think we can make much breakthrough at the moment?
21/3/14 4:26:10 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: C752A will be able to help us on 25th or 26th. From Francois, earlier might be difficult.

27/3/14 4:42:21 am: Arnaud Esbelin: Status of tonight;

# with the new server packages;

~ some manoeuvres were performed on sector 8; the train was launched from B2 to H5, from H5 to S7, from S7 to signal 813, from 813 to S8, from S8 to H5 and from H5 back to B2. The train passed thru the TC 828 without any issue..( the new server release is validated)

~ the links of ATC for sector 8 and 9 were tested with C752A support.

# both SIG RTU are running with the new configuration, with RTU as Primary. Both DMS links were rebooted to ensure the connection.

The system is healthy!
27/3/14 4:51:33 am: Ming Hwee Tan: Sector 10 GAMA and TSR is still blue.i have collected the logs.

5/4/14 6:58:46 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Who investigated march 19th occurrence?
5/4/14 6:58:57 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Me and Arnaud R.
5/4/14 7:00:00 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Who it make sense for one of you guys to have a look? Or anyone can?
5/4/14 7:01:49 pm: Takashi Yoshida: I can go, I guess.
5/4/14 7:03:57 pm: Pierre Balthazar: If you can. I guess it would be best
5/4/14 7:04:38 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Can I make claim for a movie ticket that's going down the drain?
5/4/14 7:07:49 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Definitely
5/4/14 7:14:31 pm: Arnaud Roubaud: @takashi n pierre: triky for me to go right now  at site and give some support to takashi: it is my sister's last day in sg.... But if needed i can go at 0:00 to take over from takashi. Sorry for that... 
5/4/14 7:23:19 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Thank,s Arnaud
5/4/14 9:56:49 pm: Takashi Yoshida: There will be a restart of servers at OCC. It'll be from 1-4 am.
5/4/14 9:58:53 pm: Takashi Yoshida: I'm gonna be around for it.
5/4/14 10:05:22 pm: Takashi Yoshida: PasCtl crash is the same as March 19. Consistent with Marc's investigation.
5/4/14 10:06:04 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Mmmmm. Same user action as well?
5/4/14 10:06:47 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Not sure at the moment. I'll send the order of events after my dinner.
5/4/14 10:07:03 pm: Pierre Balthazar: No pros. Thanks a lot
5/4/14 10:07:49 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Are you going to be available on Monday for a meeting? LTA wants to have a meeting.
5/4/14 10:08:09 pm: Pierre Balthazar: I will. Do we know what time?
5/4/14 10:09:09 pm: Takashi Yoshida: I don't know yet. It'll also depend if we have good analysis to present or not.
5/4/14 10:09:22 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Indeed. Let's see then
5/4/14 10:09:50 pm: Takashi Yoshida: @Arnaud, can you tell me what to look out for on DMS?
5/4/14 10:10:51 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Don't mean to disrupt your last night with your sister but I've got to ask. Sorry.
5/4/14 10:37:40 pm: Mohamed Rozaini: @Takashi, there should be a gap of 3 scswatchdog cycle, causing the DMSE
5/4/14 10:39:17 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Thanks. According to the SBST, it didn't go to DMSE. Only to DMS.
5/4/14 10:39:28 pm: Takashi Yoshida: At least that's what they say.
6/4/14 1:31:23 am: Sylvain Bougerel: on tmc log in ATS, look for the watchdog send messages.
6/4/14 1:32:03 am: Takashi Yoshida: Arnaud is helping me. Thanks.
6/4/14 1:32:26 am: Takashi Yoshida: What's the diff between DMS and DMS-E?
6/4/14 1:32:46 am: Sylvain Bougerel: if you can access nelwiki, I recently created a page to investigate DMSE
6/4/14 1:32:46 am: Sylvain Bougerel: Okay, cool.
6/4/14 1:33:27 am: Takashi Yoshida: No wiki here.
6/4/14 1:34:21 am: Sylvain Bougerel: My understanding is that DMS-E is a transition state. It happens when the HII is in ISCS mode, but ATS fails to send watchdog for more than 15 seconds.
6/4/14 1:34:43 am: Sylvain Bougerel: In this case DMS will assume HII in DMS-E.
6/4/14 1:35:21 am: Sylvain Bougerel: Soon after (another 15 seconds later, it seems) , HII will go back to DMS.
6/4/14 1:37:45 am: Sylvain Bougerel: HII determines which system can send control to DMS. HII in nominal mode is ISCS, but when it falls back to DMS, it means DMS will work with his saved timetable.
6/4/14 1:38:34 am: Sylvain Bougerel: Or something like that. My guess is that DMS does not have the intelligence to regulate trains. So the idea is to get back to ISCS HII as soon as possible.
6/4/14 1:41:32 am: Sylvain Bougerel: Ming-wah will not more about it.
6/4/14 1:41:32 am: Sylvain Bougerel: s/not/know/
6/4/14 1:41:32 am: Sylvain Bougerel: DMS-E, E stands for emergency
6/4/14 9:48:47 am: Ming Wah Tham: Morning. Sorry I missed all your messages last night. Slept early. Yes, Sylvain is correct. When we miss 3x5s watchdog cycles, DMSE takes over. Signalling system will run trains on our behalf in DMSE mode based on our last timetable downloaded to DMS. Once the watchdog recovers, DMSE mode ends, but HII still remains in DMS. Operator has to consciously take control back to ISCS. This is a safety arrangement that the Operator must be involved. If u say, there is DMS without DMSE, it means the DMSE kinda "toggled" => triggered and recovered. ATS must have been blocked or busy for a short while, then recovered. If PasCtl went faulty at that time, it might have caused it.
6/4/14 9:50:53 am: Ming Wah Tham: You should be able to find some Orbacus errors in the tmc_logs or scs_logs.
6/4/14 9:51:33 am: Ming Wah Tham: Maybe TAO errors, if we've swapped out ORBACUS for TAO.
6/4/14 9:55:07 am: Imran bin Omar: Just for info sharing.... something non-technical though...
Last time SBST takes opportunity to claim SF whenever there's DMSE in our maintenance contract for as long as system not recovered if confirmed fault at our side... as DMSE potentially cause train delays.

But then again now no more maintenance contract...
6/4/14 9:56:08 am: Imran bin Omar: SF - system failure.... involves $$$....
6/4/14 11:48:56 am: Takashi Yoshida: Before I fall back in sleep again, I'd like to inform everyone that logs and partial analysis are at http://takashiyoshida.info/c755a_logs/2014-04-05-crash
6/4/14 11:50:40 am: Takashi Yoshida: We still don't know why the OCC operators were unable to control and set routes after they set the HII back to ISCS. maybe someone can have a look at the logs.
6/4/14 11:51:02 am: Pierre Balthazar: Thanks Takashi.
6/4/14 11:53:02 am: Takashi Yoshida: The analysis is in a 2014-04-05-CMS_crash.md. It's a markdown text file. You can use any text editor and read it. Or change the file extension to .txt.
8/4/14 5:49:52 pm: ‪+65 9749 1446‬: Tonight testing. Thomas Leung (96394003) from C752A will be supporting SIG ITC.
8/4/14 5:50:38 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: Okay thank you Andy!
8/4/14 7:33:42 pm: Yi Xu: Sorry just curious, can any one tell me what is C755A-1392 in jira about？
8/4/14 8:25:08 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Rozaini, can you help to take logs from SKG and PGL on April 5th?
8/4/14 8:26:30 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Xu Yi, we already discussed about task C755A-1392 before. If you want, I can talk to you about it tomorrow.
8/4/14 9:03:44 pm: Mohamed Rozaini: Okie dokie
8/4/14 9:05:31 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Thanks a lot.
9/4/14 6:32:58 am: Mohamed Rozaini: Pre-ITC UPDATE
9/4/14 6:34:58 am: Mohamed Rozaini: No effect seen on HMI with changes done to RTU download & EVariables files
9/4/14 6:35:23 am: Mohamed Rozaini: GAMA for sector 10 remains blue
9/4/14 6:37:33 am: Mohamed Rozaini: Radio PTT investigation proves that ISCS not at fault. C760A Ricky was present throughout the test and will be following this up in the next ITC meeting
9/4/14 6:40:24 am: Mohamed Rozaini: Only scs logs available on SKG and PGL. The gws and sig logs have been overwritten. No logs present on OCCGWS3A either during the 5th Apr incident.
9/4/14 6:45:54 am: Mohamed Rozaini: NED DB package note: NED EVariables file owner and group under root, to modify for next DB release.
9/4/14 6:46:55 am: Pierre Balthazar: No logs at OCCGWS3A? Any explanation?
9/4/14 6:47:04 am: Pierre Balthazar: Thanks a lot for the update btw!
9/4/14 6:48:00 am: Mohamed Rozaini: Yeah, kinda weird. Takashi already noticed this when he was on site on Sat
9/4/14 6:53:33 am: Pierre Balthazar: Was that reported to Lta?
9/4/14 6:58:12 am: Mohamed Rozaini: Not yet
9/4/14 6:58:33 am: Pierre Balthazar: Ok. I'll bring that up at today's meeting
9/4/14 6:58:58 am: Pierre Balthazar: On signalling side. Did we manage do perform any test?
9/4/14 7:51:20 am: Pierre Balthazar: Btw, for SKG and PGL sig and GWS logs, it is normal for them to be overwritten?
9/4/14 9:37:40 am: Takashi Yoshida: At least for the GWS logs, it should have been there when I was at OCC.
9/4/14 9:39:21 am: Pierre Balthazar: That's true for SKG and PGL too?
9/4/14 9:40:03 am: Pierre Balthazar: I'm trying to understand if the Daren overwrites these logs after a while and if we were unlucky to look for them too late or if it requires manual intervention. Please enlighten me :-)
9/4/14 9:46:39 am: Pierre Balthazar: Read system. Not Daren
9/4/14 9:49:00 am: Takashi Yoshida: For sig logs, they should also have been there on Apr 5. But I didn't look for it then so I don't know now.
9/4/14 9:49:49 am: Pierre Balthazar: Does the system overwrite logs? If yes, how long is the cycle?
9/4/14 9:50:54 am: Takashi Yoshida: Bit curious about the sig logs at SKG and PGL. I would have expected them to be in logold with scs_logs.
9/4/14 9:51:56 am: Takashi Yoshida: They are usually archived in tarballs. Not sure how often they are removed. Maybe someone in the office can check for us.
9/4/14 9:53:01 am: Pierre Balthazar: Please! I need this info. Today's meeting is going to be bloody and I need amunitions...
9/4/14 9:54:39 am: Stephanie Rendal: System writes the logs until *.30 i think then overwrites them starting back to *.0 and they r archived in logold only if the system is restarted.
9/4/14 9:54:47 am: Arnaud Roubaud: Sig logs is only 3 hours roughly - scs log around 5 days
9/4/14 9:57:49 am: Pierre Balthazar: GWS?
9/4/14 9:58:30 am: Arnaud Roubaud: No sorry i was unclear: those cycle are cms env log cycle.
9/4/14 9:59:03 am: Arnaud Roubaud: Oops ats env not cms
9/4/14 9:59:48 am: Pierre Balthazar: Aaaarrrrggggg
9/4/14 10:00:38 am: Pierre Balthazar: SMS sig logs (if any): how long?
GWS logs: how long?
9/4/14 10:00:41 am: Pierre Balthazar: Ha ha ha
9/4/14 10:02:27 am: Sylvain Bougerel: Logs are removed only when an environment is started. The command for clean up is in nel_start. sh and I think it is every 30 days.
9/4/14 10:02:50 am: Sylvain Bougerel: That is for server logs btw. GWS logs work a little differently I think
9/4/14 10:03:28 am: Sylvain Bougerel: sorry, not "every 30 days"  but "if older than 30 days"
9/4/14 10:04:23 am: Stanley Lim: If I remember correctly , every restart of GWS. The system will renamed the previous log file with date and start a fresh file.
9/4/14 10:04:39 am: Pierre Balthazar: Does it mean that on servers we should ALWAYS have logs for the last 30 days?
9/4/14 10:05:05 am: Pierre Balthazar: And that for GWS if not manually cleaned, they'll be there, renamed?
9/4/14 10:05:11 am: Marc Oliver Castañeda: For ats sig it is 10 mins per file over 30 files
9/4/14 10:06:24 am: Pierre Balthazar: I'm sorry, I feel dumb... 😩
9/4/14 10:06:35 am: Stanley Lim: I am not aware of any clean up of previous GWS log mechanism.
9/4/14 10:07:26 am: Marc Oliver Castañeda: For gws there are only 5 files rolled over. Each log is only max 10000 lines.
9/4/14 10:07:47 am: Pierre Balthazar: We've got missing GWS logs at occgws3a, SKG and PGL
Missing sig logs at SKG and PGL
I want to know if there was a mandatory human action for these logs to disappear. 
And so far I don't feel I got a definite answer. Sorry
9/4/14 10:07:50 am: Marc Oliver Castañeda: For occgws1 at least this will last less than 1 day
9/4/14 10:08:22 am: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Now this is depending on operator action
9/4/14 10:09:38 am: Stanley Lim: Hi Marc, do the system clean up previous log file during startup of gws application ? Sorry I am not in office and cannot check the startup batch file.
9/4/14 10:10:25 am: Marc Oliver Castañeda: It will backup the current logs
9/4/14 10:10:50 am: Stanley Lim: Ok. So there is no deletion ?
9/4/14 10:10:55 am: Imran bin Omar: I made a quick call to Matthew, for server logs they will be transfer to logold folder. For GWS, the old gws logs they will be renamed and remain in the log folder. 
In the C755, all old log files remain in server for 2mths for server and for GWS also if not removed
9/4/14 10:11:22 am: Marc Oliver Castañeda: However during gws session if there are too many logs it will just overwrite the oldest since it is rolling
9/4/14 10:11:52 am: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Of course this depends on operator activity
9/4/14 10:12:46 am: Takashi Yoshida: But in that case, it should have deleted older logs from occgws3a. When I was there, I didn't see the logs corresponding to the time of incident.
9/4/14 10:14:48 am: Jean-Louis Tang: The server logs are archived to the 'old' directory on every startup and will be deleted if older than 30 days AND if the free disk available is less than 50 mb.
9/4/14 10:15:23 am: Arnaud Roubaud: @takashi:No older log are kept. Only files of the current gws session can be deleted by the roll over mechanism
9/4/14 10:16:18 am: Imran bin Omar: The main pt to prove I believe is that our system will not delete old log files too fast.... true for both GWS & servers.
9/4/14 1:14:34 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Functional question: would ATS automatically run trains slower in case on 1 train stall to avoid bunch up?
9/4/14 1:15:37 pm: Takashi Yoshida: @Arnaud, Jean-Louis: I might not come back before demo so please coordinate the demonstration when Nurul arrives at 3 pm.
9/4/14 1:22:17 pm: Stephanie Rendal: pierre, i don't think so, as far as i know. If a train stalls in front of them, they will stop until it moves.
9/4/14 1:22:42 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Thanks Stephanie.
9/4/14 1:28:16 pm: Stephanie Rendal: but also theres regulation mode where trains distance themselves based on headway (distance between trains). Sorry i totally dorgot about that
9/4/14 1:29:01 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Ha ha ha. Ok
9/4/14 1:30:11 pm: Pierre Balthazar: I've got the feeling every time I ask something here I either receive "maybe" or "it depends" as an answer 😳
9/4/14 1:32:29 pm: Pierre Balthazar: It's a joking note btw. Don't take it seriously
10/4/14 9:07:34 am: Ming Wah Tham: Hi Pierre, I just read all your messages now. Sorry it seems too late to answer now. If u still want to know, if a train stalled at a platform, the ATS will not delay the next trains at stations because SBST had sched-regulation on but turned off headway-reg. Need to confirm from OCC. Just in case if they left both reg objectives on, then the 3 trains behind (up to start of bound, whichever is less) their departure from station will be delayed a bit, but it will not prevent bunching up (cuz SBST did not turn on Tunnel reg. Need to confirm this first). If they indeed have tunnel reg on, then bunching will eventually happen to the first 3 trains behind the stalled train and not any further. ATS will put a platform hold at the previous station and stop further bunching. Oops, course starting now. Cheers!
10/4/14 10:57:01 am: Takashi Yoshida: Can someone help me with RadCtl 15:57 crash? I want to know if the call has actually gone through successfully or not. And which TCI no, if possible.
10/4/14 11:11:07 am: Alexey Pakseykin: How to check? Is there logs?
10/4/14 11:12:11 am: Takashi Yoshida: Arnaud uploaded the logs and core files in nelarchiver
10/4/14 11:12:23 am: Alexey Pakseykin: OK. I see the task.
10/4/14 11:36:48 am: Alexey Pakseykin: Is it TSI or TCI? TSI is the TETRA ID (or number). And I see almost nothing in logs related to TCI keyword.
10/4/14 11:44:30 am: Alexey Pakseykin: The last TSI I see in the logs is 4014-5-525. Apparently, it was not successful (RadCtl crashed around this time) - it is related to alarm handling and it looks different from other calls in the log. Screenshot follows...

11/4/14 11:09:54 am: Chi-Duc Duong: @Sylvain: R u able to access your email? I can send you some queries to collect old events
11/4/14 11:12:26 am: Sylvain Bougerel: It's okay, I will do it by batches, unless you think it's really better that I do it by queries cause I can get more info or something..
11/4/14 11:15:33 am: Chi-Duc Duong: Yeah, you can do by batches. Queries are just to bypass the limit of event number in Crystal Report.

11/4/14 11:23:25 am: Sylvain Bougerel: This filter does not seems to give a lot of useful information. Should I try something else?
11/4/14 11:25:43 am: Sylvain Bougerel: Trying something else. Sorry for the noise. I think my filtering skills suck a bit.
11/4/14 11:27:13 am: Takashi Yoshida: Hmm. Not entirely sure. Can it show what the SKG and PGL operators were doing between 18:20 to 19:20? OCC handed controls over to stations and we want to know what they did.
11/4/14 11:27:58 am: Sylvain Bougerel: Okay. There are some Handover alarms, I will selext this
11/4/14 11:28:05 am: Takashi Yoshida: Also what OCCGWS3A was doing around the same time.
11/4/14 11:28:54 am: Chi-Duc Duong: Can you also check all options in the Operational group box (Low, Urgent, Critical)?
11/4/14 11:32:39 am: Marc Oliver Castañeda: U can choose a location and choose all systems
11/4/14 11:33:14 am: Marc Oliver Castañeda: We only need skg and pgl right? And specific time range
11/4/14 11:34:28 am: Sylvain Bougerel: Okay, so better check everything basically. (except the cctv alarm maybe, which seems to be a lot and not useful)
11/4/14 11:36:22 am: Marc Oliver Castañeda: But maybe we generate the report per location i guess
11/4/14 11:36:33 am: Marc Oliver Castañeda: No need to sort it
11/4/14 11:39:57 am: Mohamed Rozaini: @Sylvain, there used to be a crystal report that can extract all events from nedgws1, can use that as an alternative
11/4/14 2:16:07 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Sylvain found occgws3a logs (partial) from nedgws1a. Unfortunately it's only from 2 to 4 pm.
13/4/14 12:28:00 am: Stephanie Rendal: @arnaud e, i put ur name in the sheet signed by bala, but i dont know ur number
13/4/14 12:29:22 am: Arnaud Esbelin: Thank you Stephanie,I'll do the rest.  I'm still on my way..
15/4/14 3:08:14 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: For those participating in IOCC Meeting, sorry, I will reschedule the meeting. Sorry, current meeting is dragging.
15/4/14 3:25:44 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Ok
15/4/14 3:26:38 pm: Stanley Lim: Ok
15/4/14 3:36:59 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Tingting says: "okay. pls proceed to inform IVVQ team to prepare the CRF first. just update on previous version."
16/4/14 4:09:04 am: Arnaud Esbelin: Hi guys,

We are glad to let you know that we are finally receiving the Gama on sector 10 and
ATC 10 is not blue anymore !

Hoping that I woke you up,

16/4/14 6:41:57 am: Pierre Balthazar: Fantastic news. Thanks and well done
16/4/14 6:42:04 am: Pierre Balthazar: That's great news. Any reason or did it just worked?
Have we left any configuration/SW on-site or reverted everything?
16/4/14 7:15:46 am: Ming Wah Tham: 👍👏
16/4/14 10:30:25 am: Alexey Pakseykin: Where is the meeting today?
16/4/14 10:30:45 am: Pierre Balthazar: Emr1 at 10:45
16/4/14 10:31:00 am: Alexey Pakseykin: Thanks
16/4/14 10:57:57 am: Arnaud Roubaud: @pierre: the pb was that we used a server table id that was bigger than 255 (eg. 351) and this id is actually coded over only one byte in the messages that are exchanged between rtu and iscs. We changed the server table id to 254 and it worked (there are still a few blue objects in the schematics... We probably need to check the db config). I am gonna commit the change by today in svn so that it can be deployed next week end.  
16/4/14 10:58:31 am: Arnaud Roubaud: Also we reverted everything
16/4/14 10:59:20 am: Pierre Balthazar: Thanks a lot for the update
16/4/14 10:59:55 am: Sylvain Bougerel: All this we must put in a wiki page before we lose it...
16/4/14 12:38:23 pm: Arnaud Roubaud: Hi all. I did the modification for gama issue in branch 1555 + db changes (production on going). But i had some issues when trying to reintegrate the branch into shared... And no more battery on my laptop😞. Could one you reintegrate branch 1555 into shared for me? Thanks in advance for that! 
16/4/14 12:46:37 pm: Stephanie Rendal: i'll check when i get back to office if someone did and i'll do it myself if not
16/4/14 12:52:19 pm: Arnaud Roubaud: Thank you stephanie! Give me a call if any issue.
16/4/14 1:03:47 pm: Takashi Yoshida: No deployment on this Sunday. But we'll use Sunday for ITC instead.
16/4/14 1:09:00 pm: Stephanie Rendal: @Arnaud, I committed already, no issues
16/4/14 1:09:47 pm: Arnaud Roubaud: Great! Thanks again!
16/4/14 1:23:42 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: In fact please not that there will not be any deployment until further notice. Takashi and Alexey will explain to you guys
16/4/14 1:34:52 pm: Nimesh Chauhan: All right noted.  Thank you for the info.
16/4/14 5:45:55 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Hi, the meeting with SBST for the changes in DRMD/DSOD went well, in a sense that they didn't reject the changes. One of the SBST guy has commented on the description of the alarm, I have asked him to discuss with LTA first about it. Therefore, if needed, we can start implementing the changes present in the proposal. Cheees

2/5/14 2:39:35 pm: Nimesh Chauhan: Hi team. 
I have deployed the release 13.33 at tds. 
I am trying to test some pcr for the depot sector 10. And by default currently it seems sector 10 is disabled. 
So It seems I need to enable the sector 10.
But I couldn't found the enable script under below path.  
Home/Operned/shl

2/5/14 2:42:56 pm: Alexey Pakseykin: OK... Give us a moment.
2/5/14 2:43:20 pm: Nimesh Chauhan: All right
2/5/14 2:46:18 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: Can you access you email Nimesh?
2/5/14 2:46:55 pm: Alexey Pakseykin: The script is not in the package. Do you have it on your thumb drive? We can send you a command, if you cannot get it.
2/5/14 2:48:11 pm: Nimesh Chauhan: No...The thumb drive consists of only the current packages.
2/5/14 2:49:07 pm: Nimesh Chauhan: @Arno. ..yes
2/5/14 2:50:35 pm: Stephanie Rendal: If all else fails try this in vi but make sure to back up the file:

2/5/14 3:05:02 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Sector 10 not available means you can't see sector 10? If that's the case are we using the proper version of NELvisu?
2/5/14 3:05:49 pm: Nimesh Chauhan: No. We can view the sector 10. But unable to control it
2/5/14 3:06:41 pm: Nimesh Chauhan: No worrie...it can be enabled by. ...One of the script. ....Enable_sector10 script

5/5/14 9:02:29 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Heads up for Marc and possibly Arnaud R. We probably will have to regenerate NED DB as soon as possible with all routes in. I will need to know as early as possible tomorrow when we could deploy that new package onsite...
5/5/14 9:02:35 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Thanks as have a good evening
5/5/14 10:04:05 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Yup ting ting called me.

5/5/14 10:04:36 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: If we cannot give tomorrow fix they might ask to revert tom night
5/5/14 10:24:20 pm: Pierre Balthazar: I got a call from Tingting and Isaac. That's why I need to know when it can be ready. So we can negotiate properly...
6/5/14 1:32:41 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: Apparently both Ned just crashed
6/5/14 1:33:08 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Shit
6/5/14 1:33:47 pm: Pierre Balthazar: I would advice to keep going with our plan and investigate a bit afterwards
6/5/14 1:34:06 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Can we get logs and core files from both servers later?
6/5/14 1:34:30 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: Yeah I will
6/5/14 1:35:42 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: Sorry for the wrong info dcs2a crashed

6/5/14 1:41:01 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: Pisctl crashed
6/5/14 1:41:15 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Hmm. Ok. Definitely not as bad as two servers crashing at the same time.
6/5/14 1:43:02 pm: Takashi Yoshida: BGK's PisCtl crashed on Sunday morning too. We need to have a good look at it. Please correct logs and core files. Maybe also ask what the operator was doing at the time of crash if that's possible.
6/5/14 1:45:33 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: Yes sure...they said that they didn't do any COM operation.. But to be confirmed 😒
6/5/14 1:46:19 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Thanks a bunch
6/5/14 2:06:49 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: He guys I'm stuck.
I cannot connect to neltrs servers
6/5/14 2:07:18 pm: Takashi Yoshida: From where?
6/5/14 2:07:25 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: I found that neltrs1a and neltrs2a were not specified in the host file of each gws
6/5/14 2:07:35 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: From tds
6/5/14 2:08:21 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: But crazy thing, I can create a connexion to trs1a without host name, quite funny.
But I cannot connect to trs2a
6/5/14 2:49:56 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: They want us to stay until 4pm to wait until few trains be launched before start the second server..
6/5/14 2:53:20 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: I took the logs and core for dcs2a, I'll give them to you when I'll be back...by the way daccontrol has generated a core at the same time..
6/5/14 2:56:40 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Who's asking you to stay?
7/5/14 4:54:30 am: Arnaud Esbelin: Hi all,
Tonight, 79 points tested and PASS.
- 20 SIGN/SIGF,
- 56 TD/TDS
- 3 PT which were failed last test.
The fix for the PT___831 addresses works, it can be implemented in the code.

SIG and PT are closed with 100% completion.

Regards.
7/5/14 5:08:07 am: Nimesh Chauhan: A. 13.33 gws installed at Ltoc.

B. Unable to simulate the train test at tds. ( had a chat with Stephanie. ..it's seems to be some config issue. ..so have collected the opersim config files...As she said)

C. Stc test postponed.

Waiting for the revenue train to start. 😨😥😪

8/5/14 10:28:38 am: Chi-Duc Duong: Ok
8/5/14 10:35:55 am: Pierre Balthazar: Do we know what was to DTC exactly doing when crashes happened?
8/5/14 10:37:43 am: Stephanie Rendal: If the operator now is same as the time of crash, we can check with him
8/5/14 10:38:37 am: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Looks like we received some rad event from train based on logs sent by tingting. The rad logs i asked chi duc to retrieve from site
8/5/14 10:38:44 am: Stephanie Rendal: I just asked and he said he wasn't the one around
8/5/14 10:40:44 am: Marc Oliver Castañeda: @chi duc kindly check if the crash log u receive the rad logs correlate based on timestamp thanks
8/5/14 10:41:10 am: Chi-Duc Duong: Just get all for you
8/5/14 10:41:14 am: Takashi Yoshida: Can you ask CC if there's any record of what DTC was doing just before the crash. They took down details when PasCtl crashed in March/April. They might have some records.
8/5/14 10:41:23 am: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Thats bettee thanks!
8/5/14 10:41:27 am: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Better
8/5/14 10:41:54 am: Takashi Yoshida: That was for mainline. Not sure if they keep records for depot or not.

8/5/14 11:20:44 am: Takashi Yoshida: Can Stephanie come back with logs and core files after the test is done?
8/5/14 11:20:47 am: Pierre Balthazar: From Tingting:
Pierre, I had a quick check with our C760A team. They do not have any changes on Depot recently. Their last issue at Depot was on 19 April 2014 that the GWLD kept toggling. They restarted their equipment at their side.
8/5/14 11:22:04 am: Stephanie Rendal: They want to do another test but there is currently no communication with train due to signalling test
8/5/14 11:22:46 am: Marc Oliver Castañeda: @stephanie please get logs concerning the test thanks
8/5/14 11:22:56 am: Chi-Duc Duong: Ok. We'll bring back logs and cores asap

can you show the content of:
variable _proxy  and variable  _singleProxy  and variable vUMsg?
8/5/14 11:23:22 am: Takashi Yoshida: OK then. Maybe ask Chi-Duc to come back with the files. We need to give explanations to LTA before 3:30
8/5/14 11:23:27 am: Marc Oliver Castañeda: I checked the backtrace looks like memcpy issue when transferring sds char mag over the wire
8/5/14 11:24:11 am: Chi-Duc Duong: We're doing pis tests. Will get back to gdb after tests
8/5/14 11:25:46 am: Chi-Duc Duong: Ok. I'll come back with the files shortly

8/5/14 5:00:12 pm: Chi-Duc Duong: Nothing conclusive so far. Still looking for why that tmpTrain is null.
8/5/14 5:01:54 pm: Alexey Pakseykin: RadCom... At the moment LTI, HBF and NED2 (2 only) crashes look similar. And I tell about them. There is one pattern: they all have a wake-up on a timer during the crash. And the timer deals with session management. However, they are all going through different source lines - screenshots follow. It may be unrelated, but that's what we look into now.

3/6/14 4:45:15 am: Arnaud Esbelin: Hi all,

The SIG ITC retest of tonight shows that our dev team did a great job on the fixes;

- the fixed GAMA Pass
- the fixes on CBI Pass regarding the ASCV change-over status, the Normal and Reserve Unit status.
- the fixed TC Pass
- the FB related to the fixed TC passed.

On the ATS ITC progress,
2 tests were done;
- DEP_ATS_ITC_0001 PASS
- DEP_ATS_ITC_0002 PASS 80% pending until we get a train on sector 10 to verify the car number.

Global SIG ITC status;
$ On 1525 points only remain 12 points FAIl and it seems to be on C752A side,

Only remain as FAIL the TC 1023 and TC 818 ( under investigation for C752A)

The ball is in their court!

Cheers!
3/6/14 4:50:16 am: Arnaud Esbelin: To precise, 62 points were tested tonight.

And we are waiting for C752A to give us explanations on why the concerned TC on sector 9 can't be controlled by ISCS.
Regards.
3/6/14 5:42:07 am: Pierre Balthazar: Fantastic job all of you. Thanks for that!

I believe that's gonna be difficult for us to conduct our testing in good conditions...
6/6/14 9:02:05 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: it's okay, the mail is not directed at you. It seems that we have to take it on ourselves to also double check with François. Give a call to your supporting NWRP personnel, and ask them to confirm the testing.
6/6/14 9:15:58 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: Yeah in fact tingting replied to François as well with a great msg...I thanked her for that.
7/6/14 4:01:16 am: Arnaud Esbelin: Hi guys,
Is there a way to verify in our logs, if we properly sent a work request to MMS ?
C756A didn't receive from us, I'm quite surprised, I send ard 30+ work request I want to verify.
Thank you in advance...
7/6/14 4:04:38 am: Arnaud Esbelin: Ok wrong alert! In fact they received it, sorry for that.
7/6/14 4:22:58 am: Sylvain Bougerel: Good. They should receive it.
7/6/14 6:04:47 am: Arnaud Esbelin: Status of tonight,

We managed to pass TC 1023 with the linked fixed block and GAMA.

Still not able to test the global GAMA on the NOT AUTHORIZED BY ATC. And Train localisation information.

I believe that we should have a serious talk with C752A about that since we tryed to test it few times already and they still don't know how to do...

Regarding the TTCU test for ATS ITC, we didn't signed the teat case because we were still able to control the Signal 1003 even with the controls on TTCU side and even in emergency mode when we should not be able to control anything related to TT2.
I took the logs, I'm afraid that without traces it will be difficult to find something...
Need investigation.

On the C756A test, most of the send request to MMS are now correct except 6 of them,
Christine will forward the updated list.

Unfortunately, for the coming tests it smells quite bad to hope support from C752A due to their availability. we'll see.

Wishing you a good weekend,
Cheers.

9/6/14 4:43:40 am: Nimesh Chauhan: Hi all. 
Today we started executing the ats itc 0019 manoeuvre
Observations. 
Test from
Train 016 from H5 to s17e/1018
at 02:44:21, rout were set & train start routing, 
at 02:44:59 & 02:45:00 their was an alarm WBS LINE FAIL,
at 02:45:31 train 016 got stalled (stopped).
And train was unable to route further anymore.  And our test was got stopped. 
Logs are collected.
9/6/14 8:27:02 am: Pierre Balthazar: Thanks for the update Nimesh
9/6/14 8:27:46 am: Pierre Balthazar: Sylvain, Takashi: no crash meeting with mr. Koh this morning

9/6/14 6:57:40 pm: Stephanie Rendal: From C752A ICD (highlighted is WBS Line Fail)
9/6/14 6:58:48 pm: Stephanie Rendal: doesnt seem related to sector  10 or some routing . Most probably their issue
9/6/14 7:20:22 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: You managed to find the meaning of WBS in the ICD?
9/6/14 7:20:59 pm: Stephanie Rendal: No it was not there. Just the error itself.
9/6/14 7:21:36 pm: Stephanie Rendal: Im out of office now tho
9/6/14 7:22:15 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: What, you ALREADY out of office... unacceptable!
9/6/14 7:22:24 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: :-P
9/6/14 7:22:46 pm: Stephanie Rendal: hahaha!
9/6/14 7:24:56 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: We'll have a phone chat with François tomorrow to see if they have a clue.
9/6/14 7:27:27 pm: Stephanie Rendal: i will also ask signalling tonight . but considering the manoeuvre was applied successfully, the route was properly set, the occupancy was ok... its just that the train stopped with AP in front and that is not our control already.
9/6/14 7:28:05 pm: Stephanie Rendal: Though im hoping no wbs line fail tonight so we can do the test.
9/6/14 7:29:49 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Cannot be a branch issue or something of that sort? - just asking, don't hesitate to tell me if it's completely unrelated - I think it is unrelated - but just in case
9/6/14 7:32:36 pm: Stephanie Rendal: if it was branch/abscissa issue it would affect localisation and the train window display (we will have teleporting train again) but we can double  check on that
9/6/14 7:44:49 pm: Ming Wah Tham: When a train de-localises, an AP appears as a "force-field" for protection. SIG usually blames the ISCS for some action or inaction or late action that causes the train to de-loc.
9/6/14 7:46:29 pm: Ming Wah Tham: In the depot, a very rare scenario could be setting the route too late. Anyway, let them figure it out.
9/6/14 7:48:38 pm: Stephanie Rendal: From the video nimesh showed me the route was clearly set and the train started to move past the signal.
9/6/14 8:31:22 pm: Nimesh Chauhan: @sylvain n @stephanie.
For tonight test how do u fill adding some traces will be helpful for our further investigation.
Just an opinion.
9/6/14 8:46:05 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: That is a very good idea nimesh. However, I do not recall the traces that have been set in the past and are safe.
9/6/14 8:47:17 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: I believe l1 to l6 are by default today, but I think we also had some more...
9/6/14 8:48:14 pm: Nimesh Chauhan: Okay noted. Thanks for the information.
10/6/14 3:47:41 am: Stephanie Rendal: Status of Tonight's Test

This time the train used was the one signalling used for testing and so it was proven to be working. 

The train routed to sector 10 stabling (veeeery sloooowly). Possibly yesterdays issue was due to a faulty train. WBS line failure was just a normal alarm according to them and it is not expected to cause issue (and in fact we keep seeing it also tonight).

Train correctly stopped at S18E and from there some MMS tests were performed, all failed: sending of various wash codes and send various restriction codes. In both cases, inspector panel was not updated. 

However inspector panel is updated when requests comes from ISCS, except wash codes via maintenance panel.

Last test was train routing back to H5 via manoeuvre assignment and it failed due to the second route not being set. Route was set manually and allowed train to go on.

No more time for further tests.

We got logs.

11/6/14 3:52:47 am: Stephanie Rendal: Status of Tonight's Test

The following RT to Stabling Manoeuvres were tested and PASSED:
- RT1 to S17E
- RT2 to S17E
- RT3 to S17E

The following Stabling to RT/H5 Manoeuvres were tested and FAILED:
- S17E to RT1
- S17E to RT2
- S17E to RT3
- S17E to H5
* The failing part of the manoeuvres were during the second route setting (signal 1004). Same as yesterday's failure. This signal is the entry point from Sector 10 to Sector 8. If this is not fixed, most likely all manoeuvres from Sector 10 stabling going out will fail. So this is priority issue.

We did not have time for testing more manoeuvres or other Stabling tracks S13-S16 (yesterday, we tested with S18) since according to C752A they are not yet available for testing. 

We also did not decide to test W-side stabling since it will require sleep and wake up of train which will take longer. 

Logs will be collected for investigation.

I've check the database config and the profile config and according to the functional and geographical categories, DSM is supposed to receive.

They will investigate on their side.

12/6/14 5:50:57 pm: Nimesh Chauhan: All right
12/6/14 5:51:41 pm: Takashi Yoshida: I don't understand your message. What's 'interpretation'?
12/6/14 5:56:17 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: @Nimesh ,
Please remember to backup the ScsEnvList on servers and GWS since TDS is a special configuration.
12/6/14 5:56:34 pm: Takashi Yoshida: If you're still having problem starting the CMS environment, please stop all scadasoft processes and try starting it again.
12/6/14 5:57:42 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Check the host file on neltrs1a. Make sure the ip addresses are correct.
12/6/14 5:57:44 pm: Nimesh Chauhan: Yes arnaud. ..I did it.
12/6/14 5:58:11 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: Cool! And yea this host file as well
12/6/14 5:58:27 pm: Nimesh Chauhan: Yes
12/6/14 6:05:26 pm: Takashi Yoshida: ScsEnvList should have the correct host names; neltrs1a and neltrs2a

12/6/14 6:12:04 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: it should already be there
12/6/14 6:12:32 pm: Ming Hwee Tan: We already set the mode manually
12/6/14 6:12:53 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: is it the standby doing this?
12/6/14 6:13:06 pm: Ming Hwee Tan: Meaning?
12/6/14 6:13:22 pm: Ming Hwee Tan: The online is having problem
12/6/14 6:13:24 pm: Nimesh Chauhan: No. .we have not yet installed the second server
12/6/14 6:13:29 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: if that is the case, check the time difference between the online and standby....
12/6/14 6:13:32 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: okay
12/6/14 6:13:48 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Is the standby still running?
12/6/14 6:14:33 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: kill all scadasoft related processes, including taonameserv, scswatchdog and scsextwatchdog
12/6/14 6:14:36 pm: Nimesh Chauhan: Currently non of the environment is running.
12/6/14 6:14:38 pm: Ming Hwee Tan: No
12/6/14 6:14:44 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: and retry
12/6/14 6:15:24 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: post a pic of the ScsEnvList contents if possible
12/6/14 6:15:29 pm: Nimesh Chauhan: As of now we are just installed the package into the trs1a only and have notyet touched the trs1a
12/6/14 6:16:10 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: make sure taonameserv is also not running on the other server

12/6/14 6:22:53 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Ok, let us know the result. We're also trying at the platform here.
12/6/14 6:23:29 pm: Ming Hwee Tan: Is the sftp server supposed to be running
12/6/14 6:23:57 pm: Nimesh Chauhan: In platform I test before coming to tds. ..it is working good.
12/6/14 6:24:42 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Also, please post a picture of the top part of the hostfile (/etc/host), make sure that localhost is defined and the neltrsXa does corresponds to your server' IP address
12/6/14 6:25:08 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: the sftp is supposed to be running, yes
12/6/14 6:26:15 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: In the ScsEnvList, I am surprised to see all the GWS defined, although I don't think it should prevent you to start.
12/6/14 6:26:33 pm: Ming Hwee Tan: It is working now.
12/6/14 6:27:05 pm: Takashi Yoshida: I don't see any trsgwsXa though. I hope it's at the bottom of the file.
12/6/14 6:27:33 pm: Ming Hwee Tan: I believe it is because not all the process in all environment are being stopped.
12/6/14 6:31:05 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Cool. Now we know how to fix it next time.
12/6/14 6:33:14 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: maybe the change in scadasoft inputmgr library caused some misbehaviour with Tao...
12/6/14 6:35:20 pm: Takashi Yoshida: I think we should get into a habit of stopping all SCADAsoft processes when we update SCADAsoft. Unless it's totally unnecessary or wrong.
12/6/14 6:36:29 pm: Ming Hwee Tan: We should do that if we are running multiple environment on the same server
12/6/14 6:36:44 pm: Nimesh Chauhan: The best way is to reboot the server.

13/6/14 3:24:50 am: Ming Hwee Tan: Results for sump pump test:

The result is the same as the previous test.the highhigh status of sump pit level cannot be triggered. SBST subcontractor is satisfied with c713 installation of sump pump as per previous design.during  pre itc,lta has verified that by triggering from our ITB that we are able to receive the correct status. Now the issue is to convince SBST to accept the particular status cannot be triggered.

13/6/14 10:08:43 pm: Pierre Balthazar: So please tonight make sure of a couple of things:

14/6/14 1:01:55 am: Edgar Chong: Hi guys, today's software release installation is cancelled.
14/6/14 1:13:03 am: Takashi Yoshida: Any particular reasons and the next possible date?
14/6/14 1:14:40 am: Edgar Chong: Bcos c775a not providing sufficient standby support after release installation.
14/6/14 1:16:28 am: Edgar Chong: Sorry.. typo c755a
14/6/14 1:16:52 am: Takashi Yoshida: I was under the impression that NWRP made agreeable arrangement with SBST. Wonder what would have been the "sufficient" support to the SBST?

14/6/14 1:20:59 am: Takashi Yoshida: Did Jason say anything about next likely installation date?
14/6/14 1:22:08 am: Takashi Yoshida: Damn. SKGANA will also be affected by this cancellation. Their packages contain 13.36.
14/6/14 1:27:29 am: Sylvain Bougerel: Damn....
14/6/14 1:27:52 am: Sylvain Bougerel: Seriously. This is really outrageous.
14/6/14 1:28:13 am: Sylvain Bougerel: They are going really far this time.
14/6/14 1:30:01 am: Edgar Chong: Correct Takashi. SKG A&A will be affected. I have mentioned this also to Jason.
14/6/14 1:38:34 am: Sylvain Bougerel: we had planned for ppl to stay for 24h anyway, so isn't there a way out of this?
14/6/14 2:23:00 am: Edgar Chong: Unfortunately, there isn't.
14/6/14 2:23:35 am: Edgar Chong: To Alexy and Ming Hwee, please DO NOT come to do the standby.

14/6/14 3:30:59 am: Pierre Balthazar: Appologise for this. I had told lta we had planned for support for 24hra. But I think LTA wanted to confront SBST. I'm ready to bet that on Monday I'll been asked to officially request for delay due to this so LTA can smack SBST
14/6/14 3:31:41 am: Pierre Balthazar: I'm sorry everyone lost their time on this. Have a good weekend without work then! See you all on Monday!

16/6/14 3:30:41 am: Stephanie Rendal: Results of Tonight's Test

Before test we backed up the following files to be reverted after the test:
- eqTSCF.xml
- eqTSCFInstances.xml

I backed up and modified the following configuration file to include a fix to be tested:
- tmc_iti.conf

We were only able to take possession at 2:10 and after all the preparation, we were able to start test at 2:40.

Only two manoeuvres were tested due to time constraints:
- H5 to S13E
- S13E to H5
Both tests PASSED. Configuration change is confirmed to be working. Routing from Signal 1004 is set, and we can assume other manoeuvres going out of Sector 10 will be fixed.

Some observations on timing:
- Preparation (install, wait for signalling to go up completely, routing train to the test's starting position) takes roughly 30mins.
- Train takes about 8 mins per manoeuvre with max observed speed as 12 and min observed speed is 2. 

After test, we reverted back, including xml files mentioned above, and the configuration file I changed confirmed to be reverted also. Point 817 and Signal 821 were originally blocked, and were unblocked during the test, and put back to blocked after.
16/6/14 3:31:20 am: Stephanie Rendal: Sorry for the long explanation LOL
Bottomline: Limited time to test, test passed, no issues encountered.
16/6/14 3:32:57 am: Stephanie Rendal: By the way, since the config change worked, any chance we can include it in the next installation? And when is the next installation?
16/6/14 3:46:54 am: Sylvain Bougerel: Well, the question is, when is the next release.
Well done Stephanie, spotting the issue.

18/6/14 9:57:35 am: Stephanie Rendal: Oh shit. Ok lets stick to previous patch. Weird though there's no "route abandoned" alarm and I'm not familiar with this conf msg alarm...
I will be in office by 10:30. Nimesh let me know when you're awake and free to talk, I'll call and interview you abt last night's test.
18/6/14 9:57:40 am: Sylvain Bougerel: see you soon then. I got your order Takashi
18/6/14 9:59:37 am: Takashi Yoshida: @Stephanie: your "interview" should be an "interrogation" instead. And make sure you repeatedly yell "who do you work for?" and "there's no time!"
18/6/14 10:00:58 am: Stephanie Rendal: Lol, noted Takashi. Nimesh, prepare yourself
18/6/14 10:01:36 am: Stephanie Rendal: (tips from an expert? Haha)
18/6/14 10:01:57 am: Takashi Yoshida: But in all seriousness, please try to figure out what happened in the tests.
18/6/14 10:02:05 am: Takashi Yoshida: Jack Bauer
18/6/14 10:05:10 am: Sylvain Bougerel: Imagine there's an dirty bomb in the train ready to explode and you have 24h to find it.

... 

Okay, take your time.
18/6/14 10:10:07 am: Stephanie Rendal: We can use the previous patch. This new one, I extended the command zone and I guess it worked for train going in but not for going out. Unless if something else went wrong since those are not the alarms i am expecting if it fails
18/6/14 10:15:41 am: Takashi Yoshida: OK, hopefully, Nimesh has logs

18/6/14 11:20:00 am: Stephanie Rendal: I will go to this test, if thats ok. Tomorrow, right? I'm not sure exactly what happened since nimesh said even the first route did not set and my changes were meant for the second route. (First route should have been normally set). If the issue is not the configuration it could be we'll see same issue tomorrow.
18/6/14 11:23:10 am: Edgar Chong: @Steph, that will be great! Thank you for your support.
18/6/14 11:23:31 am: Takashi Yoshida: The next depot possession is on Saturday morning, if I'm not wrong. Thursday and Friday possessions are not approved.

18/6/14 11:28:46 am: Takashi Yoshida: Dunno. Didn't see Thursday and Friday in Yee Sen's email so I assumed they are not approved. Maybe you know better. Please confirm and let Stephanie know so she can make a plan.
18/6/14 11:29:13 am: Stephanie Rendal: Hmm Ok I will go to whichever is the next possession. Yeah, let me know...

19/6/14 2:59:00 pm: Stephanie Rendal: Report on Today's Test with C752A

We were only able to test one manoeuvre successfully:
- RT3 to Test Track via WashPlant
* Test Track to RT3 was routed manually via wash plant because a point in the normal route was currently clamped.

We encountered many problems: 

First, I assigned the wrong manoeuvre to the train. So in the middle of the route they applied emergency brake and went in reverse via RM mode which caused the train to delocalised and it caused the  CC to scold them. We were told that we could have just allowed the train to follow the route up to S814 signal and changed of ends there, that way train will not delocalize. In the end we were able to do the test.

Second, ESB was applied due to double CBI failure (if im
not mistaken, thats what i heard them say) was detected and whole sector 8 was in red with all points and signals blocked. This took some time to recover. 

Third, when we start the second test and assign manoeuvre, manoevre cannot be assigned anymore because the system had automatically assigned the default manoeuvre because it took some time for the train to reach the signal S804 from RT3. So for this we changed of ends at S814 to restart the test again. 

Fourth, again the system automatically assigned default manoeuvre because it took so long for the train to be handed over to depot from RT3 at mainline side. We learned that system actually starts check while the train is at mainline side, not wait for it to arrive at depot. At this point we have no more time to redo the test so we stopped and reverted the system.
19/6/14 3:04:45 pm: Stephanie Rendal: I'm hoping to go this saturday morning for the test since the manoeuvre I had wanted to check (with latest patch) we did not do today. Also, C752A mentioned they want to request our support also on Saturday but on 9am to 2pm for the same test they had planned to do today. They will probably contact edgar/andy for that.
19/6/14 3:09:58 pm: Stephanie Rendal: Oh standup meeting at 3:30, im on my way
19/6/14 3:40:29 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Hi Andy, for the PA Amplifier in depot COM (Ritche) has reported they do not see alarms for on the DMS profile during their site tests.
I have checked in simulation environment, configuration is correct for these equipment: all 4 different alarm values NORMAL,  DEGRADED, AMP FAULT, LINE FAULT are reflected in the Alarms of the DMS profile, therefore it should work.
Note that these alarms are sent to us via a serial connection to the RTU. I suggest they check on their side.
19/6/14 3:49:12 pm: Andy Loy: @sylvain: Ok noted. Thanks for the information .
20/6/14 5:50:42 pm: Arnaud Roubaud: Hi, timetable issue at tds is resolved. There was a unix/windows format issue with the file that comes from hastus.
20/6/14 5:51:13 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Cool. Thanks
20/6/14 5:51:33 pm: Takashi Yoshida: It needs to be in UNIX format, right?
20/6/14 5:52:19 pm: Alexey Pakseykin: Yes.
21/6/14 2:39:29 am: Stephanie Rendal: Status of Tonight's Test

No test today because I am cursed!
No, just kidding... Ming-Whee is cursed!
No seriously, at 2:30 am still no possession so there's really no time to be able to install, test, and revert. Waiting for signalling and ISCS to install and normalize, plus positioning the train to prepare for test, takes about 30mins. And it seems that this will be the case every Friday as revenue times are much later so possession time will be much later. Just a heads up for any test scheduled on Fridays.
21/6/14 2:46:51 am: Arnaud Esbelin: Ouch!
21/6/14 2:48:32 am: Stephanie Rendal: @Nimesh
For tomorrow's (this morning) test, one way to prevent what happened last time is to assign the stabling and wash mode in advance (via Maintenance panel) so that the system will not automatically assign to default. Since the wash plant will be isolated I suppose it will not wash the train - pls confirm with C752A on this. System will detect that the train is assigned to a stabling and wash mode and *hopefully* route the train to wash plant and not assign the default one. Hopefully because Im not sure what it will do if it detects that the wash plant is disconnected....
21/6/14 2:51:21 am: Stephanie Rendal: Officially, time possession was given is 2:46. Just for the record. Again, no test will be done.
21/6/14 3:01:42 am: Sylvain Bougerel: For tomorrow, If SBST agrees, they might also run in Manual (ISCS)  through the Depot. C752A LTA says they should agree. Running in Manual should be easier for the test.
21/6/14 3:06:04 am: Stephanie Rendal: That was the plan we discussed with Nimesh so they can test their routing but i realized for our side, manoeuvres only run in auto so we cant tick off our own manoeuvres list if they test in manual...
21/6/14 3:09:44 am: Stephanie Rendal: Nimesh can still assign from Maintenance panel and if he feels its really taking a long time for train handover from mainline to depot, or some other thing might go wrong, he can play it safe and set to Manual.
21/6/14 3:50:29 am: Sylvain Bougerel: Yes good point.
21/6/14 8:20:21 am: Pierre Balthazar: That's a shame indeed. I see two positive points though:
1. That's one more argument for the extension of time
2. Sylvain, you have got home on time for France game ;-)
21/6/14 8:20:47 am: Pierre Balthazar: Joke aside. I'm sorry you guys once again did the trip to NED for nothing...

@stephanie the latest patch is working good and the train is no more stopping and able to route smoothly with out stop at S1004.
🙏
21/6/14 3:03:18 pm: Stephanie Rendal: Yay! Thanks Nimesh!
21/6/14 8:47:00 pm: Ming Wah Tham: Hi Stephanie, what did you change in the latest patch?
21/6/14 8:48:28 pm: Ming Wah Tham: Just curious. 😁
21/6/14 8:51:45 pm: Stephanie Rendal: i changed the direction and extended the commandzone. the problem last time was not the configuration (mdb) but the database - the southbound traffic direction was configured as belonging to test track . that time they were testing the test track so the traffic dirction cannot be controlled. i also put a patch for that to be used only for testing.
21/6/14 8:56:48 pm: Ming Wah Tham: Good. So extending the command zone a bit helped the train from stopping.

22/6/14 3:29:16 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Great work Nimesh. You mention that C752A has successfully completed their tests. Do you know if they still have some tests to pass? Have they spoken about getting the Safety Cert next Wednesday for good?
22/6/14 4:20:02 pm: Nimesh Chauhan: Thank you sylvain.

Meaning to say...
Test performed by c752a for the day was successfully completed.

To my knowledge I think they have no more test to perform for them but better to get confirm with them by official mail for their test status and getting the updates on safety certificate.
22/6/14 4:43:32 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Okay, we will check with LTA tomorrow. At least it's a good indication that we will go to Datapack C next Sat.

28/6/14 9:20:35 pm: Stephanie Rendal: By the way about last night/this early morning, we were not able to test the failing manoeuvre from last time (from Signal 1005) due to Point P821 being clamped All East Stablings in Sector 10 are covered for manoeuvres to/from H5 so we had no choice but to test West and they worked without issue (yay!) except that sleep and wake up takes a lot of time (not so yay!). Today we plan to get P821 unclamped (to test on failing manoeuvre) and test to reception track RT2. (As RT1 and RT3 can be tested during off peak hours).
28/6/14 9:22:21 pm: Stephanie Rendal: Also, Yee Sen informed us that the modified area (S9~S12) in Sector 8 needs a separate possession. So all those possession dates we have does not include Sector 8 test.

Any idea on this Oracle component? Us it the same issue we met before and we do have to delete ODBC?

4/7/14 11:26:21 am: Alexey Pakseykin: But I guess we should also unplug LAN. Or serial cable alone will trigger switchover? I just need some definitive indicator in logs that serial cable (and not some bug) make progress look OK.
4/7/14 11:44:28 am: Takashi Yoshida: Arnaud, we're you able to install GWS?
4/7/14 11:44:59 am: Arnaud Esbelin: Nope still not!
4/7/14 11:45:38 am: Takashi Yoshida: Is it still the same problem? Did you remove the ODBC?
4/7/14 11:51:01 am: Sylvain Bougerel: Okay, the serial cable is just to emulate the "witness" pattern in the master-slave architecture. The serial cable itself does not trigger switch over, it's the network disconnection that does
4/7/14 11:51:58 am: Sylvain Bougerel: But in case both master and slave do not see each other, the serial cable help decide which should stay up, which should go down.
4/7/14 11:52:39 am: Sylvain Bougerel: I'm not sure I was very clear
4/7/14 11:53:57 am: Sylvain Bougerel: Anyway to test redundancy with serial cable, remove the NELWATCHDOGMODE variable from both master and slave: $ unset NELWATCHDOGMODE
4/7/14 11:54:13 am: Sylvain Bougerel: then start the environment.
4/7/14 11:55:13 am: Sylvain Bougerel: to check that the cable work, on one machine, type, as root: $ echo "bouh" > /dev/ttyS0
4/7/14 11:55:37 am: Sylvain Bougerel: on the other, as root, $ cat /dev/ttyS0

4/7/14 11:56:58 am: Arnaud Esbelin: What do you mean?
4/7/14 11:57:06 am: Sylvain Bougerel: Use case. When both servers are up, one master, one slave,  disconnect the network from one of them, 1 should stay up, the other should go down.  The serial cable worked.
4/7/14 11:57:36 am: Marc Oliver Castañeda: I mean if u are just ipdating from previous version there should not be issue
4/7/14 11:57:37 am: Arnaud Esbelin: Okay thank you Sylvain.

4/7/14 11:58:18 am: Arnaud Esbelin: I've uninstall the previous version before install the new one, that's probably why....
4/7/14 11:58:36 am: Arnaud Esbelin: But this didn't happen on the platform
4/7/14 11:58:38 am: Marc Oliver Castañeda: That should not be an issue
4/7/14 11:59:04 am: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Can u check if oracle client is installed
4/7/14 12:06:24 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: Yes I did already
4/7/14 12:07:18 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Are u testing on one gws only, have u tried others?
4/7/14 12:07:55 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: I'm gonna try, I'll let you know
4/7/14 12:08:12 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: But oracle client has always been installed on this machine....
4/7/14 12:10:28 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Since no one complained about this problem last time, we should be able to install GWS. In fact I did successfully on my VM this morning.
4/7/14 12:11:50 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Yes but i guess its possible that gws configuration was changed. Or u can ask nimesh if he was able to update that particular gws last time
4/7/14 12:15:08 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: I believe he didn't encountered it since he didn't complained! Anyway I'm able to install it on the trsgws1a
4/7/14 12:15:49 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: @Marc,
Should we delete the odbc form the registry as we used to do?
4/7/14 12:16:12 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Unless that gws has not been updated for a long time, that is my suspicion
4/7/14 12:16:21 pm: Takashi Yoshida: I thought you already tried this?
4/7/14 12:16:24 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Anyway its good that u are able to install this
4/7/14 12:16:30 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Dont delete registry
4/7/14 12:16:42 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: Ok
4/7/14 12:16:45 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: The fix is to reinstall oracle client choose admin
4/7/14 12:17:10 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Of course uninstall the old one properly
4/7/14 12:17:11 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: By the the way, the gws1 which can be installed has not been updated since a while....
4/7/14 12:17:56 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: If alex is there he knows how to uninstall client properly
4/7/14 12:18:09 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: Alright
4/7/14 12:18:54 pm: Takashi Yoshida: The last update should be in June (Nimesh/Ming Hwee, or SKGANA)
4/7/14 12:21:14 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: That was not the case....still using a 13.33 version ..
4/7/14 12:22:33 pm: Takashi Yoshida: For all GWS? Or only one?
4/7/14 12:27:49 pm: Alexey Pakseykin: I think it's wrong on only one GWS. We are all busy here with multiple annoying small problems. So, some questions are just dropped here for you to think on details guys until we work on something else. Sorry.
4/7/14 12:29:47 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: Yea only one was not updated...
4/7/14 12:38:51 pm: Alexey Pakseykin: Marc, should we press Y or N:
4/7/14 12:39:16 pm: Alexey Pakseykin: 24aa7c3d45036eacf160a81db2d302c2.jpg <attached>
4/7/14 12:39:17 pm: Alexey Pakseykin: ?
4/7/14 12:41:58 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: That should not even prompt
4/7/14 12:42:18 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Make sure u are using admin user for install
4/7/14 12:44:44 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: Yes we are using c755a user
4/7/14 12:47:46 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: df7bf9e6b4c0b4ec65631d661ae4bdce.jpg <attached>
4/7/14 12:48:45 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: We are also facing the fact that hgn gws and servers IP addresses are wrongly configured on the etc/hosts file..
4/7/14 12:49:43 pm: Alexey Pakseykin: I think we should try to figure out how to tell the difference whether Oracle client is installed with Administrator or any other option and maybe check the scale of the problem on site for installation tomorrow...
4/7/14 12:50:26 pm: Alexey Pakseykin: But we may not be allowed to check...
4/7/14 12:52:00 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: I think some prerequisite software moght mot be installed
4/7/14 12:52:21 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Alex can u use your salt config to auto install?
4/7/14 12:52:24 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Auto configure
4/7/14 12:55:44 pm: Alexey Pakseykin: I'm not ready for doing it on site. It's just out of expectations now. Besides, we have to uninstall existing client and there is no automation for uninstall (install or update config only).
4/7/14 1:02:08 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Ok
4/7/14 1:05:48 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: I think this is lesson learned. Every deployment of packages, all machines should be updated , no exceptions.
4/7/14 1:28:34 pm: Takashi Yoshida: If you go to ORACLE_HOME\install\chainedInstall, you'll find a file globalcontext.xml. Open it and look for 'INSTALL_TYPE'. It should tell you what kind of Oracle client was installed (Administrator, Runtime, etc)
4/7/14 1:28:52 pm: Alexey Pakseykin: Great.
4/7/14 1:29:29 pm: Takashi Yoshida: FYI, the factory has Runtime installed
4/7/14 1:30:27 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: So let's find why we were able to install the new gas without getting this issue
4/7/14 1:40:55 pm: Takashi Yoshida: @Arnaud E., Is Microsoft Access database engine 2010 installed?
4/7/14 1:45:36 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Never mind, that won't cause the same issue.
4/7/14 1:51:30 pm: Takashi Yoshida: @Arnaud E., OK, I can reproduce the issue if the ORACLE_HOME points to a directory that doesn't exist. Can you check your ORACLE _HOME?
4/7/14 2:10:51 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: Ok let me check, I'll let you know..thanks for your investigation!
4/7/14 2:13:44 pm: Takashi Yoshida: You might have multiple Oracle clients installed too. In that case, you'll need to adjust the ORACLE_HOME to the correct client.
4/7/14 2:41:19 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: 5e932a651559d8f3d05e2e8f12082fdd.jpg <attached>
4/7/14 2:41:26 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: It seems to be correct!
4/7/14 2:41:55 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: Should I create a new variable but for user?
4/7/14 2:42:13 pm: Takashi Yoshida: No. Don't do that.
4/7/14 2:42:36 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Can you check the D drive and see if there are more than one client installed?
4/7/14 2:44:35 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: 844ad947cde56ed53419b476b8dfbfa1.aac <attached>
4/7/14 2:45:16 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: There's only one client!
4/7/14 2:45:47 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Hmm. Too bad then. I'll need to investigate more.
4/7/14 2:48:16 pm: Takashi Yoshida: What kind of client is this? Admin, runtime or something else?
4/7/14 2:50:21 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: ae82be6b16a3a489a58c2a9bd1d4f7e9.jpg <attached>
4/7/14 2:50:26 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: This is what I was afraid of!
4/7/14 2:52:03 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Reinstall using admin
4/7/14 2:53:34 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: Ok but we'll have to do it on all the gws over the system tmr!
4/7/14 2:54:16 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Why?
4/7/14 2:55:01 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: And in fact the gws on which we can install gws app is the one with the cinfigurator, so arnaud thinks that it works because of Oracle server
4/7/14 2:56:53 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: Ok Why? Coz if I'm not wrong, on that oracle installation time, we did install it for all the clients with the runtime option,
Edgar, can you confirm it?
Our wiki regarding oracle install recommend the runtime installation by the way...
4/7/14 2:59:29 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: e76feed62199e977e91bb84f6e9241ea.jpg <attached>
4/7/14 3:00:38 pm: Alexey Pakseykin: Wiki has probably fixed, but I did this mistake myself. I think in the past it just didn't matter and we installed the minimum, then it started matter, but why test platform didn't have the issue if it's runtime-only?
4/7/14 3:03:29 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: Two more questions guys,

The new script which do a check on the local config with redundant environment running currently shows some differences ,

# Is OCCGWS6A really needed ?

# what name ltagws is supposed to be?

Ltagwsa
Ltagws1a
Ltagws
Or ltocgws?
4/7/14 3:04:45 pm: Takashi Yoshida: I don't remember seeing any changes that would suddenly require admin Oracle client.
4/7/14 3:18:15 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Should be ltagwsa
4/7/14 4:16:06 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Tried uninstalling the GWS on one machine and installed the latest one. No error occurred on that machine.
4/7/14 4:20:42 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: I'm still having the same error for trsgws2a
4/7/14 4:22:09 pm: Takashi Yoshida: But is the GWS installed?
4/7/14 4:22:30 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Or does the error cause GES to be removed?
4/7/14 4:22:45 pm: Takashi Yoshida: GES=GWS
4/7/14 4:25:41 pm: Nimesh Chauhan: Hi small arnaud. 

Actually u would have take the backup of whole nelgws folder and the host file and  then uninstalled and remove or delete the nelgws folder and then start installed the new gws pkg and then just need to replace the scsenvlist file and the host file with the backup files.

That's it run the scs start.

This is what I use to do in tds.
 
But at occ and station no need to do this.

Hope this helps you.
4/7/14 4:30:13 pm: Nimesh Chauhan: U will cannot install in  Trsgws2a as this is know issue. So just skip installing in this machine.
4/7/14 4:31:20 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Known to who? and since when? And why are we not fixing it?
4/7/14 4:31:50 pm: Nimesh Chauhan: To c755a team
4/7/14 4:33:27 pm: Nimesh Chauhan: From day one when tds gws installation was done... ..this is what I know.
4/7/14 4:35:45 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: I didn't know about that! And it seems that lta neither by the way! So should we just keep the installation?
4/7/14 4:37:50 pm: Nimesh Chauhan: It cannot be they know very well. ..in the all past crf they have never been signed for Trsgws2a. We have the evidence.  So don't worry.
4/7/14 4:37:59 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Also an error on this machine was previously identified, there is no reason why it should not work. Maybe, as Nimesh says, clean the previous install and reinstall
4/7/14 4:38:50 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: the issue on this machine was that the utility panel (bottom panel) was not displayed. It was not investigated furthur for lack of time
4/7/14 4:40:46 pm: Nimesh Chauhan: And the same process I use to follow in platform.
4/7/14 4:42:18 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: My bad I just discovered that lta knew it! They just didn't told us...few hours of investigations spent...anyway I'll delete and re-install Oracle client and see...
4/7/14 4:46:02 pm: Takashi Yoshida: It's our bad for not keeping everyone updated. It's definitely not a well-known issue. We still need to fix it if SBST hasn't signed off on it.
4/7/14 4:46:48 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: No worries I'll update you once oracle will be reinstalled.
4/7/14 5:08:20 pm: Takashi Yoshida: @Arnaud E., if you are going to install GWS on trsgws2a again, please get installation log.
4/7/14 5:13:24 pm: Takashi Yoshida: 1. Go to Start menu and type 'cmd'
2. Navigate to the directory with GWS installer (example: cd Desktop, if the installer is at the desktop)
3. Type 'msiexec /i NelGwsInstaller_13.36.538.7276.msi /Lv install.log'
4. Install the GWS and collect install.log
4/7/14 5:21:11 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: f4789011cd68025ed52d4e565bfb3157.jpg <attached>
4/7/14 5:22:05 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: It seems that the client reinstallation fixed our issues, even the bottom panel!
So I'm not gonna get the logs Takashi
4/7/14 5:22:33 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: Gws installation didn't prompt any error msgs by the way
4/7/14 5:22:47 pm: Takashi Yoshida: cool. How did you fix it?
4/7/14 5:22:57 pm: Takashi Yoshida: And is depot not running now?
4/7/14 5:32:14 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: Yea lol no worries depot is down 😜
4/7/14 5:33:09 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: I didn't do much, just reinstalled oracle client and gws .
4/7/14 6:05:48 pm: Takashi Yoshida: oracle client is reinstalled as Admin or runtime?
4/7/14 6:08:26 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: Runtime I just wanted to make sure it was working with knowing that all our clients on the system are install in runtime, so she should not face this issue for tmr install!
4/7/14 6:16:31 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Great! Thanks
4/7/14 6:21:14 pm: Alexey Pakseykin: OK, basically now we have no idea why it didn't work on trsgws2a.
4/7/14 7:19:48 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: Ok so tds is fully installed on both servers.

For each trsgws; 

- NELgws
- FTP config
- Thunderbird
- Microsoft Expression Encoder 4.

-We'll still need to go down to fix on each environment the ScsEnvList to make it consistent for both servers.

- it seems that a TRS sim process block the standby server to start for stations ( to be disabled to fix it)
Need to be clarified.

- the encoder DEMO was done so there's no need for you guys to do it again tonight.

Good luck for the deployment.
4/7/14 7:20:56 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Thank you!
4/7/14 7:22:30 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: Oh and important stuff, Alex has fixed the yum repo so from now yum will be used to install soft @ TDS
4/7/14 7:23:47 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Cool !
4/7/14 7:49:30 pm: Edgar Chong: Thank you guys!
4/7/14 11:30:02 pm: Takashi Yoshida: who'll be at the OCC with Rozaini tonight?
4/7/14 11:37:08 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: Nimesh
4/7/14 11:37:28 pm: Takashi Yoshida: OK, thanks.
5/7/14 4:51:58 am: Nimesh Chauhan: Hi all.
We are successfully completed 
nelmail installation and preinstallation of packages in to all the servers & gws of occ, ned & nel.
Regards.
5/7/14 11:53:14 am: Sylvain Bougerel: Thanks Nimesh
5/7/14 1:37:49 pm: Jean-Louis Tang: What time do we meet tonight for the installation?
5/7/14 1:39:53 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: Hi all,
We'll meet at 12:15 at the sbst lobby with a team brief before start the installation.
5/7/14 9:07:20 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Hi can somebody bring an aithorized usb drive. Just in case there is a crash or something we can immediately retrieve core and logs. Just pass to the next one in rotation.
5/7/14 9:07:57 pm: Nimesh Chauhan: Yes sure I have it with me. 👍
5/7/14 9:08:54 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Ok thanks i have a drive but im not sure if i can use based on the new process.
5/7/14 9:15:30 pm: Nimesh Chauhan: Can use it but only the thing is need to get the scan reports. That's it.
6/7/14 12:04:59 am: Arnaud Esbelin: Hi guys,
Let me know when you reach, I got your EPIC cards!
6/7/14 12:05:39 am: Jean-Louis Tang: I m dere already.
6/7/14 9:09:59 am: Pierre Balthazar: Hi all. How did things go this morning?
6/7/14 11:44:08 am: Takashi Yoshida: If anyone from the installation shift is up, please tell us how the installation went.
6/7/14 11:45:47 am: Takashi Yoshida: @Edgar, if no one sends update before you get to your shift, maybe you can get info from the morning shift and give us an update?
6/7/14 11:46:33 am: Edgar Chong: Ok.
6/7/14 11:53:33 am: Edgar Chong: 1) dms: hmi status failure issue. referred by SIG 

2) issue at LTI PD21 referred to COM. 

3) dbs server when generated the dbs log is empty
6/7/14 11:53:44 am: Edgar Chong: Sent by Izad.
6/7/14 11:56:24 am: Marc Oliver Castañeda: I have a question if cc raised a critical issue are we authorized to resolve on site if we are able to? Or is our task is just to monitor and collect info?
6/7/14 11:58:19 am: Takashi Yoshida: @Edgar, thanks. Can you take screenshots of each issue and send them to us?
6/7/14 11:59:43 am: Edgar Chong: Ok. I will do that.
6/7/14 12:00:22 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Being an engineer by nature i am tempted to fix problems but with the plethora of rules instituted by operator i doubt if i can just do whatever i deem is necessary 😛
6/7/14 12:02:23 pm: Takashi Yoshida: @Marc, it really depends. But SBST may not authorize you to do anything until the engineering hours. IN ANY CASE, you'll need to discuss with LTA and SBST. If they do agree to your fix, make sure you get the agreement in writing and signed by LTA and SBST.
6/7/14 12:04:47 pm: Takashi Yoshida: And if they allow us to fix something on the spot, they might demand that C755A stick around until the first train. In that case, we need to send someone to replace you.
6/7/14 12:07:20 pm: Takashi Yoshida: And if you fix something, please write down the exact steps. We need to be able to fix it again after the ATS tests are over.
6/7/14 12:08:56 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Ok will do that.
6/7/14 12:43:44 pm: Edgar Chong: When SBST TO tries to generate HISEVENT logs, the log file is empty.
6/7/14 12:46:51 pm: Edgar Chong: @Marc,  do you have any idea? TO said that this issue happens before and he said that you came down to fix it. He mentioned that maybe is due to the database is full?

6/7/14 12:54:25 pm: Edgar Chong: Ok. Thanks.
6/7/14 1:07:09 pm: Nimesh Chauhan: Hi all status for today's ats itc testing. 06th July 2014.

Possession from dtc@03:30pm
Test started@03:35am
Test ended@04:10am
Possession to dtc@04:15am

DEP ATS ITC 0019 ongoing

We managed to do 2 manoeuvres for our ATS ITC 0019.
• RT1 to S13E_WP pass
• S13E to RT2 pass

After the depot test 
Points and signal are blocked. (P817 p821 p823 s821& s822)

Today we where successful & smoothly able to install the package into the all server's and gws without any critical issues.
After installing we performed
PA, CCTV, ATA, PIS to the train and we successfully able to perform the train wash detergent mode from RT1 to S13E. 

Sorry for the late update.
Next time will make sure to update on-time.
6/7/14 1:08:15 pm: Edgar Chong: Thank you so much.

6/7/14 1:30:20 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Thanks guys for the updates. Further to the good directions Takashi has given, do not attempt any fix unless you are certain of the fact that your actions will correct the fix and cause no further regression. It's a bit obvious, but better play on the safe side even if authorization is given.
6/7/14 1:33:16 pm: Jean-Louis Tang: However, during the installation, we experienced the following concerns:
1. On each sms environment startup, same warning msg related to the host file appears (with different contain) like 'occgws6a, hgngws1a... ip @ not correct...'

2. Unable to start ats/cms standby environments bcos of the different contain in their scsenvlist file (manual fix to remove the nelgws01, nelgws02, nelgws03 n nelgws04 coming from nowhere);

3. At depot, unable to send control as all the sio, dio,aio were disabled. Manual fix to enable them back in the pmsb ev file.
6/7/14 1:35:01 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: point 2, these instances where added by us, for the testing on cut-over, we should have removed them long ago
6/7/14 1:35:28 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: they correspond to the 3 gws that where at the back
6/7/14 1:36:06 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: I am glad to hear you removed them.
6/7/14 1:49:58 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Thank you all for the good work and for the status. 
If I sum up:
Installation: some small issues all fixed (to be avoided next time if possible)

Afterwards, 4 issues noticed/reported:
1. DMS HMI, sent to is by SIG
2. PIS @ LTI. Sent by us to Comms
3. DBS server logs seem empty
4. HISEVENT logs seem empty from TO point of view

Did I get it right?
6/7/14 1:53:21 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: @edgar can u request operator to generate report of events this morning using the archive tab, lets say 8 to 10. If no report is generated maube dbs issue is similar to before, no records being inserted.
6/7/14 1:55:16 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: meaning db is full?
6/7/14 1:56:04 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Yes like before maybe tablespace is full
6/7/14 1:58:09 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: hopefully with Jean louis 's fix, that's the last time we need to do that.
6/7/14 1:58:49 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: or we should check if the fix was already present in may release?
6/7/14 1:59:42 pm: Takashi Yoshida: I think that fix just got in this morning
6/7/14 2:06:03 pm: Imran bin Omar: Can something like info task be created in Jira or lesson learnt for site-installation issues be tracked?... so that can do some checks to catch these things at our Changi platform where possible or at least future installers can expect to check on these things & know what to do when they happened in case JLT or NC or EC not there next time round.... 😁
6/7/14 2:10:44 pm: Edgar Chong: @Pierre, 3 and 4 issues are the same.
6/7/14 2:15:58 pm: Pierre Balthazar: @Imran: good point
6/7/14 2:16:18 pm: Pierre Balthazar: @Edgar: I thought so. Just wasn't sure. Thanks
6/7/14 2:16:35 pm: Edgar Chong: No problem.
6/7/14 2:20:10 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: @Imran, if dbs issue is the one we are thinking about, we hope this release will fix it. For the other DMS issue, we need to raise a task indeed

6/7/14 3:00:28 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Ok looks like to similar to the previous issue of full tablespace size. I know the sql command to run. Should i proceed to fix at site if lta and sbs allow me to do so?
6/7/14 3:01:07 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: In any case this was due to happen, i was expecting this to happen around march/april
6/7/14 3:04:29 pm: Pierre Balthazar: @Marc: I'm ok for you to fix at one condition: a piece of paper explaining:
- it comes from a  know issue that has been fixed in the release just installed (better if you have a reference number)
- steps to fix the result of the past issue
- signature by SBST, lta and you
6/7/14 3:27:34 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Come to think of it, there was an issue fixed before that should prevent this from happening (dbs env not cleaning up).
6/7/14 3:28:07 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Since this happened again looks like the fix is not working
6/7/14 3:55:48 pm: Edgar Chong: The fix should be in this release. PCR: C755A-1540.

6/7/14 7:55:43 pm: Jean-Louis Tang: @ marc, sorry, can't recall the trace to look for but i just remember that dbs is now holding more than 7-month old data, so the cleanup may still be under progress. Perhaps we should wait until monday evening to confirm if the fix is working...
6/7/14 7:58:25 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Hm, but records should still be inserted right?

6/7/14 9:21:42 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Do we need to do backup (or can we?)?
6/7/14 9:22:43 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: We cannot backup since data has been purged
6/7/14 9:26:51 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Too bad. Is the cleanup performed on schedule? If so, do we have a working backup procedure that SBST can perform?
6/7/14 9:28:51 pm: Jean-Louis Tang: Never try before but i think can restart even if the cleanup is under progress... yup, i was thinking if we can get all the data from pwmxd, hisevt and hisvalue only in case cleanup fails... if cleanup still under progress, i suggest let it continue to see the result even if it will be very time-consuming.
6/7/14 9:35:12 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Can I ask a stupid question:

What does the maintenance manual say?
6/7/14 9:37:24 pm: Takashi Yoshida: I have to check the manual. I need to find out if the manual has a working procedure or not.
6/7/14 9:39:23 pm: Pierre Balthazar: It was kind of a rhetorical question. I just don't want us to fix something which is working the way it's supposed to but is not used properly...
6/7/14 9:40:06 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Though, there might
6/7/14 9:40:16 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Be a few answers in there
6/7/14 10:00:16 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: the dbs tables are supposed to be backed up periodically by the maintenance team
6/7/14 10:01:03 pm: Takashi Yoshida: My question is whether we provided a working procedure for them to run backup.
6/7/14 10:02:05 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: As far as I know, it has always been running dbs_backup.sh under the oracle account
6/7/14 10:02:46 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: or something along these lines
6/7/14 10:02:58 pm: Takashi Yoshida: In that case, I recall one Jira task that says that script crashes
6/7/14 10:03:13 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: The to told me they use that but really dont store them for a long time
6/7/14 10:03:16 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Not sure it always crashes or not though
6/7/14 10:04:39 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: yes, I do recall the same thing. Do note that they have not reported the issue.
6/7/14 10:05:23 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Yes, I'm aware of it. I think we reported it ourselves. Not sure when though.
6/7/14 10:07:12 pm: Takashi Yoshida: @Marc, what do they mean by "don't store them for a long time"? I'm not familiar with the script so I don't understand.
6/7/14 10:15:46 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Maybe we shouldn't have to worry about doing a backup, because someone else (sbst) is responsible for it. I expect that if Marc is still able to see data in the tables, we could wait for a bit to see if things normalize? @marc are you abke to verify if the tablespace is still full? if it's not, have you tried an archive query again?
6/7/14 10:22:42 pm: Alexey Pakseykin: If the "backup" cmd is the one I tried to get db data from site 6 months ago, then it always crashes.
6/7/14 10:34:30 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: My phone is going kaput. The plan now is to wait and monitor the purging until ot finishes maybr for 1 to 2 days
6/7/14 10:34:43 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Then apply the manual fix extending tablespace
6/7/14 10:35:05 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: I am not confident of doing anuthing until purge is finished
6/7/14 10:35:39 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Can u add 85198403 to this group?
6/7/14 10:43:41 pm: Jean-Louis Tang: Yup, at least we hv evidence that the cleanup for hisevt is still under way(we still dun see the trace showing that the cleanup result is ok or not). Let's wait until  it properly completes its job and see the result.

Of course not applicable with current setup but that was the commitment given as PM, preventive maintenance.

7/7/14 11:58:25 am: Stephanie Rendal: Regarding train issue, there was a misunderstanding. There is a known signalling issue for train going to RT, though we were not informed, and we were not supposed to test with RT today. So we dont need to prove that its not our fault.
7/7/14 2:02:23 pm: Stephanie Rendal: We retest same manoeuvre as this morning (riding on c752a possession) and no issue, so this test is passed

9/7/14 9:41:20 am: Takashi Yoshida: @Pierre: sooner or later, I'll get there. Sooner, probably.
9/7/14 9:50:14 am: Jean-Louis Tang: @marc, thnx for yr info. When u said 'dbs issue resolved', u mean, u manually fix something or let the cleanup finish its job by itself?
So the cleanup for hisevt, hisvalue n powmxd are completed?
9/7/14 9:51:58 am: Marc Oliver Castañeda: No i did not do anything recovered by itself like what we expected
9/7/14 10:01:38 am: Jean-Louis Tang: Gr8! Thnx!
9/7/14 10:07:38 am: Sylvain Bougerel: Some remaining questions.
 1. is the Dms status still fail? can someone post picture of the dms eqt inspector panel so we know which input is incorrect?
 2. is the GGAMA still inconsistent between depot and occ?
9/7/14 10:22:15 am: Imran bin Omar: Sorry Marc, so meaning in future release installation, we somehow need to pre-empt the operator what to expect for DBS?
9/7/14 10:24:03 am: Marc Oliver Castañeda: No, system is now behaving correctly. Anyway since we are now actively i reminded alan to make arrangements for daily backup of data
9/7/14 10:24:55 am: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Actively purging
9/7/14 10:53:40 am: Ming Hwee Tan: Results for AM train withdrawal test

Train test starts 10:06am
Train test ends 10:30am

1 manoeuvre done
Rt2/S15W (train 19)

Not enough time to run the second manoeuvre as the operator has some issues with TWP when the first train comes in.

Inform DTC to block P817 after train send back to buffer area.
9/7/14 11:09:03 am: Stephanie Rendal: Any idea what those TWP issues are?
9/7/14 11:15:13 am: Ming Hwee Tan: Not related to iscs
9/7/14 11:15:58 am: Stephanie Rendal: Okies hehe just checking
9/7/14 11:23:10 am: Sylvain Bougerel: If you have sometime Ming-Hwee, can you look into the questions above, I'd like to have an update on this if possible, I am meeting C752A later.
9/7/14 11:27:12 am: Ming Hwee Tan: All trains are supposed to go for daily wash today.there is a system override for the TWP just when the train is at RT.so there is some confusion at that time. Also the operator assign the stabling based on the stabling instead of using assign manoeuvre.
9/7/14 11:28:15 am: Stephanie Rendal: I think Sylvain was talking about his questions above, not TWP. But thanks hehe
9/7/14 11:30:23 am: Ming Hwee Tan: Didn't saw his message.
9/7/14 11:32:06 am: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Some remaining questions.
 1. is the Dms status still fail? can someone post picture of the dms eqt inspector panel so we know which input is incorrect?
 2. is the GGAMA still inconsistent between depot and occ?
9/7/14 11:32:50 am: Ming Hwee Tan: We already left occ
9/7/14 4:28:00 pm: Takashi Yoshida: I need someone to have a look at one issue with stabling table issue tomorrow (starts around 9:30). Does anyone want to go?
9/7/14 4:29:44 pm: Takashi Yoshida: There's an issue with stabling table becoming empty when the train goes through TWP.
9/7/14 4:31:04 pm: Stephanie Rendal: I can go
9/7/14 4:31:37 pm: Takashi Yoshida: It should already be in the JIRA, but I can't remember the task ID. The external ID is DCS/C755A/14/0027.
9/7/14 4:31:49 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Thanks, Stephanie
9/7/14 4:34:17 pm: Stephanie Rendal: C755A-1726 which may or may not be related to 1625
9/7/14 4:38:33 pm: Stephanie Rendal: Do you know if closing and reopening the stabling table works?
9/7/14 4:39:45 pm: Takashi Yoshida: I do not know off hand. Did the previous stabling table issue had the same thing?
9/7/14 4:40:39 pm: Stephanie Rendal: Previous issue(s) have stabling table blanking out when wash mode is assigned. But at some point this problem disappeared and stablig table was normal.
9/7/14 4:42:25 pm: Stephanie Rendal: Issue from phase 1 when P815 was new. But after testing some phase 2 packages seems to be not observed anymore (I personally saw stabling table OK during some wash plant test). Anyway I can ask the operator some questions tomorrow
9/7/14 4:44:13 pm: Takashi Yoshida: It could have been that the table was OK on a different screen. But please go ahead and ask the operator and find out for sure.
9/7/14 5:10:40 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Reminder to myself: create a new task to configure environment to start with spylog enabled.
9/7/14 5:14:30 pm: Takashi Yoshida: Another reminder to myself: Figure out how to support caller ID and phone directory for TEL
9/7/14 5:14:43 pm: Stephanie Rendal: Previous issue was stabling table blanks out when wash mode is assigned -- train hasnt even reached 815 yet. I guess now the issue moved...
9/7/14 5:15:17 pm: Takashi Yoshida: With the train...
9/7/14 5:17:12 pm: Stephanie Rendal: There is a tel directory in the database "TELD_0001" tabSUB attribute.

9/7/14 9:07:29 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Knowing Sylvain I'm sure he created a Jira task for the penguins hunting ;-)
9/7/14 9:17:40 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Ahah! You've blown me away!   Pretty good job so far!

Training completed.
All tests passed.
I'm finally out.
11/7/14 12:31:32 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: 👍
11/7/14 1:08:32 pm: Alexey Pakseykin: From now on any new software component/library/installer, any change to software *, any required configuration changes (config files, environment variables, etc.) should be formally registered in content register (to replicate, sync and validate all them in "nelarchiver" between sites) and automated via modification of Salt states (if it's not done by installers/RPMs themselves).
I'm saying this as there is no point to argue. Try. :) There is a way to convince anyone next time your disk crashes (or when new major updates need to be done in TRS, IOCC, factory).

Whether we use Salt on site or we don't, when we need it, it will be tested for quick & consistent setup/upgrade in offline environments from clean state.

Wiki's are still required, but may contain buggy high level notes and highlights while all details checked in, tracked, automated and tested in the Salt states.

15/7/14 12:19:04 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: Did someone already tried to send a "emergency running mode request" on the routing at depot?

I can't send it, C752A receive the command on their side but we get a bad return condition..
Any ideas?
15/7/14 12:21:39 pm: Pierre Balthazar: If c752a receives the command, what do they answer? Why don't they perform the command?
15/7/14 12:24:57 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: It seems to be not that clear for them neither, Thomas see that we send the request command and says that another command should follow behind like "OCC out of service" but I'm not too sure about that.
Does anyone knows how this emergency running mode works?
15/7/14 12:27:04 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Well. I don't know for sure. But if their answer isn't correct it seems normal we don't sent the next command...
15/7/14 12:29:22 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: Ok I agree, I'm checking the logs to see what we get back from them..
15/7/14 12:34:12 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Wouldn't it be easier to ask them? 😜
15/7/14 12:36:40 pm: Pierre Balthazar: Said so, if someone who knows what (s)he's talking about could shed some light....
15/7/14 12:48:01 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: I'd like to know if we can see the bad return cdt I'm our logs?! If yes were can I get it?
15/7/14 12:50:51 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: In our logs* sorry
15/7/14 1:03:06 pm: Stephanie Rendal: Sig_log or scs_log but depends on trace levels
15/7/14 1:03:07 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: hi Arnaud, from theoretical stand point, I think you first need to go in Manual mode, then send the emergency running mode request, afterwards HII should fallback to DMS
15/7/14 1:10:44 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: @Sylvain, I tried in both manual and auto mode, it didn't work...
Anyway I'm on my way back to office, I took the logs for you guys..

Our train localization info was not performed, sadly their simulator was not working :/
15/7/14 6:56:49 pm: Nimesh Chauhan: Hi guys 
can anyone share me the number of christine from C756a.

20/7/14 4:50:43 am: Edgar Chong: @Nimesh and Stephanie,  since we are increasing the traces level in the morning for the stabling table issue, Please test again from RT3 to S9E. If the problem still persist at least we have the logs to troubleshoot. Bcos it looks like we have problem with the manoeuvres from RT2 and RT3 to sector 8 stabling. And we need to solve this issue asap. For the getting of logs, please check with duty TO if they installed the security system to NEDGWS1A. If not, please proceed with the current procedure, get thumpdrive scanned and create the scanned report.
20/7/14 4:51:30 am: Edgar Chong: If yes, please check with them on the new procedure. Thanks.

About the Withdrawal testing this morning,

RT2 to S16E_WP pass
RT2 to S12E fail,
The train didn't move, stuck on signal S803.

We'll collect the logs for it...

Regards.
21/7/14 10:40:09 am: Takashi Yoshida: @Stephanie: Edgar told me the stabling table issue happened this morning. Arnaud (or Edgar) will collect logs so maybe there's something we can use to figure out what's going on.
21/7/14 11:13:20 am: Takashi Yoshida: @Edgar: if you're still at OCC, can you get system logs from ECS environment (nelscs2a)?
21/7/14 11:28:41 am: Arnaud Esbelin: Hi Takashi,
Which logs do you want exactly?
21/7/14 11:37:30 am: Takashi Yoshida: LTA is requesting us to have a look at the system logs that might show which processes were crashing around 13:51 on July 15th. I don't know what the logs are called and where to find them. Maybe Sylvain or Alexey may know where such logs might exist.
21/7/14 11:38:39 am: Stephanie Rendal: @Takashi, Edgar told me the stabling table issue did not happen this morning. I may have misheard... I'm going there to get logs (also for sector 8 failing manoeuvres) before going to work .
21/7/14 11:39:15 am: Takashi Yoshida: Gah, I thought he told me it happened.
21/7/14 11:40:01 am: Takashi Yoshida: I think Arnaud is going to collect logs so maybe you don't need to go there. Or maybe you want first hand account before the stories get messed up.
21/7/14 11:42:45 am: Takashi Yoshida: @Stephanie: can you call Edgar first and confirm so you don't waste your time making a trip there?
21/7/14 11:50:20 am: Sylvain Bougerel: get these, you will need sudo to copy in full

21/7/14 11:50:53 am: Stephanie Rendal: Im going to get the logs. Edgar said It happened before their test according to DTC. I'll also confirm with him.
21/7/14 11:51:10 am: Takashi Yoshida: @Arnaud: I need your help to get /var/log/messages*
21/7/14 11:51:13 am: Stephanie Rendal: Ok I'll get those too
21/7/14 11:51:27 am: Takashi Yoshida: See Sylvain's message and pictures.

22/7/14 12:03:22 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: How about northbound traffic direction?
22/7/14 12:18:18 pm: Edgar Chong: Same. We also test all other tracks and it also failed. But we are told that may be track need to occupy before the control can be sent.
22/7/14 12:20:47 pm: Stephanie Rendal: In our manoeuvres, we send Release to southbound and Control to northbound traffic directions of stabling area before setting routes.
22/7/14 12:20:49 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Before in itc p2p test i see that this td Already passed. When u conducted the test before was track occupied by train?
22/7/14 12:21:09 pm: Arnaud Esbelin: C752A can confirm about the track occupancy.
22/7/14 12:22:36 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: From what i know we should be able to send controls without track being occupied
22/7/14 12:40:21 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Let's send a friendly mail to C752A to enquire about it.
22/7/14 12:41:30 pm: Pierre Balthazar: And give them a call in parallel please. We need to move fat on this

22/7/14 1:13:58 pm: Edgar Chong: @marc, we tested on S18, when there no train occupied the track, we can't set td control. Only when there train occupying the track that we can control and release the td.
22/7/14 1:28:11 pm: Stephanie Rendal: You tried on west?
22/7/14 1:28:44 pm: Edgar Chong: East.
22/7/14 1:32:39 pm: Stephanie Rendal: In manual?
22/7/14 1:33:04 pm: Nimesh Chauhan: Yes manual
22/7/14 1:33:27 pm: Stephanie Rendal: From RT to east stabling we are supposed to release and set the traffic directions first before setting routes. That is the flow of manoeuvre execution.
22/7/14 1:33:30 pm: Nimesh Chauhan: If we do in auto. ..it will give bad return
22/7/14 1:33:47 pm: Stephanie Rendal: (It should give bad launching in auto)
22/7/14 1:34:15 pm: Nimesh Chauhan: Yes it should give bad return in auto mode
22/7/14 1:34:30 pm: Stephanie Rendal: (Bad launching)
22/7/14 1:35:26 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: And having track occupancy is not part of initial condition ao that we can send control
22/7/14 1:35:37 pm: Nimesh Chauhan: It's bad launching
22/7/14 1:39:40 pm: Stephanie Rendal: Is it possible to confirm for any of stablings 1 to 6?
22/7/14 1:39:49 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Also at start of maneuver lets say s11e i should see td sb set
22/7/14 1:39:50 pm: Nimesh Chauhan: Both sector 8 and 10 (or i can say over all depot sector)

22/7/14 1:42:52 pm: Stephanie Rendal: Possible that it is not allowed via hmi. But for any RT to east stabling maoeuvres, COE, release south tradfic direction and set north traffic direction is done first before setting the route at the RT side. It has always been like this before
22/7/14 1:43:25 pm: Nimesh Chauhan: Here on depot currently system gives always bad return condition to all of the traffic direction (sector 8 &10) (Manual mode)
22/7/14 1:43:26 pm: Stephanie Rendal: Sorry , correction: release NB, control SB traffic direction
22/7/14 1:43:34 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: It should be possible to turn TD = traffic direction without track occupancy!
22/7/14 1:43:51 pm: Stephanie Rendal: Can you confirm with C752 people on site please?
22/7/14 1:43:54 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Yes this is the method we use even for s1 to s6 where they can stable trains right
22/7/14 1:44:45 pm: Stephanie Rendal: If they received the control from us.
22/7/14 1:59:12 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: Okay, after clarification with François, it is not possible to modify the TD without track circuit! (contrary to what I claimed earlier) we where able to do it before and during PTP test because they used their simulator to trick the CBI
22/7/14 1:59:47 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: So we need to test with a train... sorry for confusion!
22/7/14 2:02:00 pm: Stephanie Rendal: So if we assign a train from RT going to stabling, we should not send controls to the TDs?
22/7/14 2:02:25 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: But when setting maneuver we try to release set td first. This is uniform process for all maneuvers from rt
22/7/14 2:03:12 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: but the train should occupy the rt track no?
22/7/14 2:04:16 pm: Marc Oliver Castañeda: Yes. Actually the td we set is located  at the destination stabling.
22/7/14 2:06:40 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: okay, so clealy, something is odd.
22/7/14 2:07:14 pm: Sylvain Bougerel: let's setup a meeting with C752A, we need to clarify this with them
